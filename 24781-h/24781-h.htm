<p class="section">NEW FOES FOR OLD</p>

<p>With the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian army,
the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes saw that one other
obstacle to their long-hoped-for union had vanished.
The dream of centuries was now a little nearer towards
fulfilment. But many obstacles remained. There would
presumably be opposition on the part of the Italian and
Roumanian Governments, for it was too much to hope
that these would waive the treaties they had wrung from
the Entente, and would consent to have their boundaries
regulated by the wishes of the people living in disputed
lands. Some individual Italians and Roumanians might
even be less reasonable than their Governments. If
Austria and Hungary were in too great a chaos to have any
attitude as nations, there would be doubtless local opposition
to the Yugoslavs. And as soon as the Magyars had
found their feet they would be sure to bombard the
Entente with protestations, setting forth that subject
nationalities were intended by the Creator to be subject
nationalities. A large pamphlet, <i>The Hungarian Nation</i>,
was issued at Buda-Pest in February 1920. It displayed
a very touching solicitude for the Croats, whom the Serbs
would be sure to tyrannize most horribly. If only Croatia
would remain in the Hungarian State, says Mr. A. Kov&aacute;cs,
Ministerial Councillor in the Hungarian Central Statistical
Office, then the Magyars would instantly bestow on
her both Bosnia (which belonged to the Empire as a
whole) and Dalmatia (which belonged to Austria). That
is the worst of being a Ministerial Statistical Councillor.
Another gentleman, Professor Dr. Fodor, has the bright
idea that "the race is the multitude of individuals who
inhabit one uniform region." ... Passing to Yugoslavia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
domestic obstacles, it was impossible to think
that all the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes would forthwith
subscribe to the Declaration of Corfu and become excellent
Yugoslavs. Some would be honestly unable to throw off
what centuries had done to them, and realize that if they
had been made so different from their brothers, they were
brothers still. For ten days there was a partly domestic,
partly foreign obstacle, but as the King of Montenegro
did not take his courage in both hands and descend on the
shores of that country with an Italian army, he lost his
chance for ever.</p>


<p class="section">ROUMANIAN ACTIVITIES</p>

<p>There was indeed far less trouble from the Roumanian
than from the Italian side. On October 29, 1918, one
could say that all military power in the Banat was at an
end. The Hungarian army took what food it wanted
and made off, leaving everywhere, in barracks and in
villages, guns, rifles, ammunition. Vainly did the officers
attempt to keep their men together. And scenes like
this were witnessed all over the Banat. Then suddenly,
on Sunday, November 3, the Roumanians, that is the
Roumanians living in the country, made attacks on many
villages, and the Roumanians of Transylvania acted in a
similar fashion. With the Hungarian equipment and with
<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'weapoms'">weapons</ins> of their own they started out to terrorize.
Among their targets were the village notaries, in whom was
vested the administrative authority. At Old Moldava,
on the Danube, they decapitated the notary, a man called
Kungel, and threw his head into the river. At a village
near Anina they buried the notary except for his head,
which they proceeded to kick until he died. Nor did they
spare the notaries of Roumanian origin, which made it
seem as if this outbreak of lawlessness&mdash;directed from
who knows where&mdash;had the high political end of making
the country appear to the Entente in such a desperate
condition that an army must be introduced, and as the
Serbs were thought to be a long way off, with the railways
and the roads before them ruined by the Austrians, it
looked as if Roumania's army was the only one available.
On the Monday and the Tuesday these Roumanian freebooters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
who had all risen on the same day in regions
extending over hundreds of square kilometres, started
plundering the large estates. Near Bela Crkva, on the
property of Count Bissingen-Nippenburg, a German,
they did damage to the sum of eight and a half million
crowns. At the monastery of Me&#353;ica, near Ver&#353;ac, the
Roumanians of a neighbouring village devastated the
archimandrate's large library, sacked the chapel and
smashed his bee-hives, so that they were not impelled
by poverty and hunger. In the meantime there had been
formed at Ver&#353;ac a National Roumanian Military Council.
The placard, printed of course in Roumanian, is dated
Ver&#353;ac, November 4, and is addressed to "The Roumanian
Officers and Soldiers born in the Banat," and announces
that they have formed the National Council. It is a
Council, we are told, in which one can have every confidence;
moreover, it is prepared to co-operate in every
way with a view to maintaining order <i>&icirc;n l&#259;untra &#537;i &icirc;n afar&#259;</i>
(both internal and external). The subjoined names of
the committee are numerous; they range from Lieut.-Colonel
Gavriil Mihailov and Major Petru Jucu downwards
to a dozen privates. The archimandrate, who
fortunately happened to be at his house in Ver&#353;ac, begged
his friend Captain Singler of the <i>gendarmerie</i> to take some
steps. About twenty Hungarian officers undertook to
go, with a machine gun, to the monastery on November
7; at eleven on the previous night Mihailov ordered the
captain to come to see him; he wanted to know by whom
this expedition had been authorized. The captain
answered that Me&#353;ica was in his district, and that he
had no animus against Roumanians but only against
plunderers. After his arrival at Me&#353;ica the trouble was
brought to an end. Nor was it long before the Serbian
troops, riding up through their own country at a rate
which no one had foreseen, crossed the Danube and
occupied the Banat, in conjunction with the French.
The rapidity of this advance astounded the Roumanians;
they gaped like Lavengro when he wondered how the
stones ever came to Stonehenge.... When the Serbian
commandant at Ver&#353;ac invited these enterprising Roumanian
officers to an interview he was asked by one of
them, Major Iricu, whether or not they were to be interned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
"What made you print that placard?" asked
the commandant; and they replied that their object
had been to preserve order. They had not imagined,
so they said, that the Serbs would come so quickly. "I
will be glad," said the commandant, "if you will not do
this kind of thing any more."</p>


<p class="section">THE ITALIAN FRAME OF MIND</p>

<p>Italy was not in a good humour. She was well aware
that in the countries of her Allies there was a marked
tendency to underestimate her overwhelming triumphs
of the last days of the War. Perhaps those exploits
would have been more difficult if Austria's army had not
suffered a deterioration, but still one does not take 300,000
prisoners every day. Some faithful foreigners were
praising Italy&mdash;and she deserved it&mdash;for having persevered
at all after Caporetto. That disaster had been greatly
due to filling certain regiments with several thousand
munition workers who had taken part in a revolt at
Turin, and then concentrating these regiments in the
Caporetto salient, which was the most vulnerable sector
in the eastern Italian front. How much of the disaster
was due to the Vatican will perhaps never be known.
But as for the uneducated, easily impressed peasants of
the army, it was wonderful that all, except the second
army and a small part of the third, retreated with such
discipline in view of what they had been brooding on
before the day of Caporetto. They had such vague ideas
what they were fighting for, and if the Socialists kept
saying that the English paid their masters to continue
with the War&mdash;how were they to know what was the
truth? The British regiments, who were received not
merely with cigars and cigarettes and flowers and with
little palm crosses which their trustful little weavers
had blessed, but also with showers of stones as they
passed through Italian villages in 1917, must have sometimes
understood and pardoned. Then the troops were
in distress about their relatives, for things were more and
more expensive, and where would it end? In face of
these discouragements it was most admirable that the
army and the nation rallied and reconstituted their <i>morale</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">SENSITIVENESS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ARMY</p>

<p>Of course one should not generalize regarding nations,
except in vague or very guarded terms; but possibly it
would not be unjust to say that the Italians, apart from
those of northern provinces and of Sardinia, have too much
imagination to make first-class soldiers. And they are
too sensitive, as you could see in an Italian military
hospital. Their task was also not a trifling one&mdash;to
stand for all those months in territory so forbidding.
And there would have been more sympathy with the
Italians in the autumn of 1918 if they had not had such
very crushing triumphs when the War was practically
over. What was the condition of the Austrian army?
About October 15, in one section of the front&mdash;35 kilometres
separating the extreme points from one another&mdash;the
following incidents occurred: the Army Command at
St. Vitto issued an order to the officers invariably to carry
a revolver, since the men were now attacking them; a
Magyar regiment revolted and marched away, under
the command of a Second-Lieutenant whom they had
elected; at Stino di Livenza, while the officers were
having their evening meal, two hand grenades were thrown
into the mess by soldiers; at Codroipo a regiment revolted,
attacked the officers' mess, and wounded several
of the people there, including the general in command.
Such was the Austrian army in those days; and it was
only human if comparisons were made&mdash;not making any
allowances for Italy's economic difficulties, her coal,
her social and her religious difficulties&mdash;but merely bald
comparisons were made between these wholesale victories
against the Austrians as they were in the autumn of 1918
and the scantier successes of the previous years. In
September 1916 when the eighth or ninth Italian offensive
had pierced the Austrian front and the Italians reached
a place called Provachina, Marshal Boroevi&#263; had only
one reserve division. The heavy artillery was withdrawn,
the light artillery was packed up, the company commanders
having orders to retire in the night. Only a
few rapid-fire batteries were left with a view to deceiving
the enemy. But as the Italians appeared to the Austrians
to have no heart to come on&mdash;there may have been other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
reasons&mdash;the artillery was unpacked and the Austrians
returned to their old front. In May 1917, between Monte
Gabriele and Doberdo, Boroevi&#263; had no reserve battalion;
his troops, in full marching kit, had to defend the whole
front: they were able to do so by proceeding now to this
sector and now to that. No army is immune from serious
mistakes&mdash;"We won in 1871," said Bismarck, "although
we made very many mistakes, because the French made
even more"&mdash;but the Yugoslavs in the Austrian army
could not forget such incidents as that connected with
the name of Professor Pivko. This gentleman, who is
now living at Maribor, was made the subject of a book,
<i>Der Verrath bei Carzano</i> ("The Treachery near Carzano"),
which was published by the Austrian General Staff. His
battalion commander was a certain Lieut.-Colonel Vidale,
who was a first cousin of the C.O., General Vidale; and
when an orderly overheard Pivko, who is a Slovene, and
several Czech officers, discussing a plan which would
open the front to the Italians, he ran all the way to the
General's headquarters and gave the information. The
General telephoned to his cousin, who said that the allegation
was absurd and that Pivko was one of his best officers.
The orderly was therefore thrown into prison, and Pivko,
having turned off the electricity from the barbed wires
and arranged matters with a Bosnian regiment, made his
way to the Italians. The suggestion is that, owing to
the lie of the land and the weak Austrian forces, it was
possible for the Italians to reach Trent; anyhow the
Austrians were amazed when they ceased to advance and
the German regiment which was in Trent did not have to
come out to defend it. Everyone in the Austrian army
recognized that the Italian artillery was pre-eminent
and that the officers were most gallant, especially in the
early part of the War, when one would frequently find
an officer lying dead with no men near him. But such
episodes as the above-mentioned&mdash;it would be possible,
but wearisome, to describe others&mdash;could not but have
some effect on the opposing army, and would be recalled
when the Italians sang their final panegyric. The reasons
for the Austrian <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> on the Piave are as follows:
when the Allied troops had reached Rann, Susegana,
Ponte di Piave and Montiena, the Austrian High Command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
decided on October 24 to throw against them the
36th Croat division, the 21st Czech, the 44th Slovene, a
German division and the 12th Croat Regiment of Uhlans.
However, the 16th and 116th Croat, the 30th Regiment
of Czech Landwehr and the 71st Slovene Landwehr Regiment
declared that they would not fight against the French
and English, and, instead of advancing, retired. The
78th Croat Regiment, as well as three other Czech Regiments,
abandoned the front, after having made a similar
declaration. At the same time the 96th and 135th Croat
Regiments, in agreement with the Czech detachments,
made a breach for the Italians on the left wing at Stino
di Livenza, while Slav marching formations revolted at
Udine. The Austro-Hungarian troops consequently had
to retreat.... No one expects of the Italian army, as
<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'as'">a</ins> whole, that it will be on a level with the best, but
when the British officers who were with the Serbs on the
Salonica front compare their reminiscences with those
of the British officers on the Italian front, it is improbable
that garlands will be strewn for the Italians. Towards
the end of October a plan was adopted by the British
and Italian staffs for capturing the island of Papadopoli in
the Piave; this island, about three miles in length, formed
the outpost line of the Austrian defences. On the night
of October 23-24 an attack was to be made by the 2nd
H.A.C., while three companies of the 1st Royal Welsh
Fusiliers were to act as reserve. This operation is most
vividly described by the Senior Chaplain of the 7th
Division, the Rev. E.&nbsp;C. Crosse, D.S.O., M.C.;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and he
says nothing as to what occurred on that part of the island
which was to be seized by the Italians. Well, nothing
had occurred, for the Italians did not get across and when
the water rose they said they could do nothing on that
night. These are the words of Mr. Crosse's footnote:
"The obvious question, 'What was going to be done with
the farther half of the island?' we have purposely left
undiscussed here. This half was outside the area of the
7th Division, and as such it falls outside the scope of this
work for the time being. The subsequent capture of the
whole island (on the following night) by the 7th Division
was not part of the original plan." Afterwards, when a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>crossing was made to the mainland, the left flank was unsupported,
as the Italians did not cross the river, and thus
the 23rd Division had its flank exposed. A belief is
entertained that the Italian cavalry is one of the best
in the world; evidently it is not the best, for on that
Piave front, where thousands of Italian cavalry were
available, the only ones who put in their appearance
early in the battle were three hundred very war-stained
Northampton Yeomanry.</p>

<p>"The record of the Italian troops in the field renders
unnecessary an assertion of their courage," says Mr.
Anthony Dell;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "for reckless bravery in assault none
surpasses them." But when you have said that you
have nearly summed up their military virtues, for discipline
is not their strong suit, and they have little sense
of responsibility. On the other hand, we must remember
their admirable patience, but the great mass of the people
have not attained the level of Christianity; they are
savage both in heart and mind, with no outlook wider
than that of the family. It is the Italian proletariat
which is judged by the Yugoslavs, whose otherwise acute
discernment has been warped by the unhappy circumstances
of the time. Indifferent to the fact that he
himself is a compound of physical energy and oriental
mysticism, the Yugoslav has become inclined to contemplate
merely the physical side of the Italian, and for
the most part that portion of it which has to do with war.
The Italian long-sightedness and prudence and business
capacity are ignored save in so far as they delayed the
country's entrance into the Great War. The sensitiveness
and artistic attributes of the Italians, who gaze with
aching hearts upon the glories of a sunset, are but rarely
felt by Serbs, who gather brushwood for the fire that is
to roast their sucking-pig and who sit down to watch the
operation, haply with their backs turned to the sunset.
The Yugoslav, especially the Serb, is a man from the
Middle Ages brought suddenly into the twentieth century.
With his heroic heart and his wonderful strength he fails
to understand those people who, on account of one
reason or another, have no passion for war. And as the
military deeds of the Italians have had such effect upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>the minds of the Yugoslavs, we have alluded to them at a
greater length than would otherwise have been profitable.
The Yugoslavs despise the Italians. Also the Italians,
who concern themselves with diplomacy, are conscious
that their keen wits and their long training in the wiles
of the civilized world, their old traditions and their
prestige give them a considerable advantage over the
Yugoslav diplomat, so that this kind of Italian despises
the Yugoslav. He knows very well that the French or
British statesmen do not, amid the smoke of after-dinner
cigars, esteem his case by the same standard as that
which they apply to the case which the ordinary Yugoslav
diplomat presents to them in office hours. As for the
wider Italian circles, one must fear that the old hatred
of Germany, because the Germans seemed to despise
them, will henceforward colour the sentiments with which
they regard the Yugoslavs. It is a state of things between
these neighbours which other people cannot but view
with apprehension.</p>


<p class="section">AN UNFORTUNATE NAVAL AFFAIR</p>

<p>There was in Yugoslav naval circles no very cordial
feeling for the Italians. The Austrian dreadnought,
<i>Viribus Unitis</i>, was torpedoed in a most ingenious fashion
by two resolute officers, Lieutenant Raffaele Paolucci,
a doctor, and Major Raffaele Rossetti. In October 1917
they independently invented a very small and light
compressed-air motor which could be used to propel a
mine into an enemy harbour. They submitted their
schemes to the Naval Inventions Board, were given an
opportunity of meeting, and after three months had brought
their invention into a practical form. The naval authorities,
however, refused to allow them to go on any expedition
till they both were skilled long-distance swimmers.
Six months had thus to be dedicated entirely to swimming.
At the end of that time they were supplied with
a motor-boat and two bombs of a suitable size for blowing
up large airships. To these bombs were fixed the small
motors by means of which they were to be propelled
into the port of Pola, while the two men, swimming by
their side, would control and guide them. Just after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
nightfall on October 31, 1918, the raiders arrived outside
Pola.</p>

<p>Were they aware that anything had happened in the
Austro-Hungarian navy? On October 26 there appeared
in the <i>Hrvatski List</i> of Pola a summons to the Yugoslavs,
made by the Executive Committee of Zagreb, which had
been elected on the 23rd. This notice in the newspaper
recommended the formation of local committees, and
asked the Yugoslavs in the meantime to eschew all
violence. When Rear-Admiral (then Captain) Methodius
Koch&mdash;whose mother was an Englishwoman&mdash;read this
at noon he thought it was high time to do something.
Koch had always been one of the most patriotically
Slovene officers of the Austrian navy. On various
occasions during the War he had attempted to hand over
his ships to the Italians, and when some other Austrian
commander signalled to ask him why he was cruising
so near to the Italian coast he invariably answered, "I
have my orders." He found it, however, impossible to
give himself up, as the Italians whom he sighted, no matter
how numerous they were, would never allow him to come
within signalling range. Koch had frequently spoken
to his Slovene sailors, preparing them for the day of
liberation, and he was naturally very popular among
them. Let us not forget that such an officer, true to his
own people, was in constant peril of being shot.</p>


<p class="section">WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT POLA</p>

<p>On the afternoon of that same day, October 26th,
when the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with its army and
navy, was collapsing, Admiral Horthy, an energetic,
honest, if not brilliant Magyar, the Commander of the
Fleet at Pola, called to his flag-ship, the <i>Viribus Unitis</i>,
one officer representing each nationality of the Empire.
Koch was there on behalf of the Slovenes. The Admiral
announced that a wholesale mutiny had been planned
for November 1st, during which the ships' treasuries
would be robbed, and he asked these officers to collaborate
with him in preventing it. Koch, at the Admiral's
request, wrote out a speech that he would deliver to the
Slovenes, and this document, with one or two notes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Admiral's writing, is in Koch's possession. "If you
will not listen to your Admirals, then," so ran the speech,
"you should listen to our national leaders." He
addressed himself to the men, of course in the Slovene
language, as a fellow-countryman. He begged them to
keep quiet. He deprecated all plundering, firstly in
order that their good name should not be sullied, and also
pointing out that the neighbouring population was overwhelmingly
Slovene. Out of 45,000 men only 2000
could leave by rail; he therefore asked them all to stay
peacefully at Pola. Meanwhile the local committee had
been formed; Koch was, secretly, a member of it, and
on the 28th, Rear-Admiral Cicoli, a kindly old gentleman
who was port-commandant, advised Koch to join it as
liaison-officer. It was on the 28th at eight in the morning
that the officers who had been selected to calm the different
nationalities started to go round the fleet. That officer
who spoke to the Germans declared that one must not
abandon hopes of victory, and that anyhow the War
would soon be over. Count Thun, who discoursed to
the Czechs, was ill-advised enough to make the Deity,
their Kaiser and their oath the main subjects of his
remarks, so that he was more than once in great danger
of being thrown overboard. Koch went first of all to
the <i>Viribus Unitis</i>, but the mutiny had begun; a bugle
was sounded for a general assembly; it was ignored, and
the crew let it be known that they were weary of the
old game, which consisted of the officers egging on one
nation against another. This mutiny had not yet spread
to the remaining ships, and on them the speeches were
delivered. At the National Assembly that evening Koch
was chosen as chief of National Defence; he thereupon
went to Cicoli and formally asked to be allowed to join
the committee. When Vienna refused its assent, Koch
resigned his commission. By this time all discipline
had gone by the board, no one thought of such a thing
as office work and, amid the chaos, sailors' councils
appeared, with which Koch had to treat. The situation
was made no easier by the presence of large numbers of
Germans, Magyars and Italians, of whom the latter also
formed a National Council. On the 30th, Koch, as chief
of National Defence, asked Admirals Cicoli and Horthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to come at 9 p.m. to the Admiralty, with a view to the
transference of the military power. At 7.30, in the
municipal building, there was a joint meeting of the
Yugoslav and the Italian National Councils, and so many
speeches were made that the Admirals had to be asked
to postpone their appearance for two hours; and at
eleven o'clock, with the street well guarded against a
possible outbreak on the part of any loyal troops, the whole
Yugoslav committee, accompanied by one member of
the Italian committee, went to the Admiralty. Horthy
had gone home, but Cicoli and his whole staff were
waiting. The old gentleman was informed that he no
longer had any power in his hands; he was asked to
give up his post to Koch, and this he was prepared to do.
"It is not so hard for me now," he said, "as I have
meanwhile received a telegram from His Majesty, ordering
me," and at this point he produced the paper, "to give
up Pola to the Yugoslavs." The affair had apparently
been settled between nine and eleven o'clock. Cicoli
was ready to sign the protocol, but out of courtesy to a
chivalrous old man this was left undone; after all there
were witnesses enough.</p>

<p>During the night of October 30th-31st, a radiogram,
destined for President Wilson, was composed. "Together
with the Czechs, the Slovaks and the Poles, and in understanding,"
it said, "with the Italians, we have taken
over the fleet and Pola, the war-harbour, and the forts."
It asked for the dispatch of representatives of such
Entente States as were disinterested in the local national
question. But now a telegram was received from Zagreb,
announcing that Dr. Ante Tresi&#263;-Pavi&#269;i&#263;, of the chief
National Council, would be at Pola at 8 a.m. and that,
pending his arrival, no wireless was to be sent out. Dr.
Tresi&#263;-Pavi&#269;i&#263;,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> poet and deputy for the lower Dalmatian
islands, had always been, in spite of his indifferent health,
one of the most strenuous fighters for Yugoslavia. Two
years of the War he spent in an Austrian prison, but on
his release he managed to travel up and down Croatia
and Dalmatia, inciting the Yugoslav sailors to revolt;
many of them had already read a speech by this silver-tongued
deputy in the Reichsrath, a speech of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>the reading and circulation had been forbidden as a crime
of high treason. About 9 a.m. of the 31st there was a
meeting, on board the <i>Viribus Unitis</i>, between Tresi&#263;-Pavi&#269;i&#263;
and Koch. There was a brief ceremony, the
leader of the Sailors' Council handing over the vessel
to the deputy, as representing the National Council of
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Admiral Horthy, in his
cabin, likewise drew up a <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> to the same
effect, saying that he was authorized to do this by the
Emperor, and he supported his statement by the production
of a wireless message. Koch urged on the doctor
the necessity of sending the above-mentioned wireless
to Wilson. "The news of this great event," says Tresi&#263;-Pavi&#269;i&#263;
in an article in the <i>Balkan Review</i> (May 1919),
"was dispatched to all the Powers by wireless." But
unfortunately he seems, whether on his own responsibility
or that of Zagreb, to have prevented Koch from sending
it on that day. Captain Janko de Vukovi&#263; Podkapelski
was then placed in command of the fleet, though the
Sailors' Council at first declined to accept him. He was
at heart a patriot, but had taken no active part in Yugoslav
propaganda and, unluckily for himself, he had been
compelled to accompany Count Tisza in his recent ill-starred
tour of Bosnia, when the Magyar leader made a
last attempt to browbeat the local Slavs. Yet, as no
other high officer was available, Koch told the Sailors'
Council that they simply must acknowledge Vukovi&#263;,
and at 4 p.m. he took over the command, the Yugoslav
flag being hoisted on all the vessels simultaneously, to
the accompaniment of the Croatian national anthem and
the firing of salutes.</p>


<p class="section">THE STORY OF THE "VIRIBUS UNITIS"</p>

<p>Three hours previously to this a torpedo-boat, with
Paolucci and Rossetti on board, had sailed from Venice;
and at ten o'clock in the evening, as Paolucci tells us,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he
and his companion, after a certain amount of embracing,
handshaking, saluting and loyal exclamations, plunged
into the water. The first obstacle was a wooden pier
upon which sentries were marching to and fro; this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>was safely passed by means of two hats shaped like
bottles, which Paolucci and Rossetti now put on. The
bombs were submerged, and thus the sentry saw nothing
but a couple of bottles being tossed about by the waves.
A row of wooden beams, bearing a thin electric wire, had
then to be negotiated, and the last obstacle consisted of
half a dozen steel nets which had laboriously to be disconnected
from the cables which held them. It was now
nearly six o'clock; the two men cautiously approached
the <i>Viribus Unitis</i> and fixed one of their bombs just
below the water-line, underneath the ladder conducting
to the deck. Paolucci simply records, without comment,
that the ship was illuminated; perhaps he and his friend
were too tired to make the obvious deduction that the
hourly-expected end of the War had really arrived. A
number of officers from other ships had remained on the
<i>Viribus Unitis</i> after the previous evening's ceremony;
but the look-out, seeing the Italians in the water, must
have thought it was eccentric of them to come swimming
out at this hour to join in the festivities. A motor-launch
soon picked them up and they were brought on
board the flag-ship. "Viva l'Italia!" they shouted,
for they were proud of dying for their country. "Viva
l'Italia!" replied some of the crew to this pair of allied
officers. When they were conducted to Captain Vukovi&#263;
they told him that his vessel would in a short time be
blown up. The order was given to abandon ship, and
Paolucci and his friend relate<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that when they asked the
captain if they might also try to save themselves he shook
them both by the hand, saying that they were brave men
and that they deserved to live. So they plunged into
the water and swam rapidly away, but a few minutes
later they were picked up by a launch and taken back,
the captain having suddenly begun to suspect, they said,
that the story of the bomb was untrue. They were
again made to walk up the ladder, under which lay the
explosives. It was then 6.28. The ladder was crowded
with sailors who were also returning to their ship. "Run,
run for your lives," shouted Paolucci. At last his foot
touched the deck, and then he and Rossetti ran as fast
as they could to the stern. Hardly had they got there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>than a terrific explosion rent the air, and a column of
water shot three hundred feet straight up into the sky.
Paolucci and Rossetti were again in the water, and looking
back they saw a man scramble up the side of the vessel,
which had now turned completely over, with her keel
uppermost. There on the keel stood this man, with
folded arms. It was Vukovi&#263;, who had insisted on going
down with his ship. About fifty other men were killed.</p>

<p>When Koch came out of his house, feeling that there
must be no more delay in sending the radiogram to
President Wilson, a young Italian Socialist ran up to him
in the street and told him of the fate of the flagship. As
the news spread everyone thought it must be the work
of some Austrian officers. It was feared that they would
explode the arsenal, and that would have meant the
destruction of the whole town. Amid the uproar and
chaos, Koch had placards distributed, saying that the
<i>Viribus Unitis</i> had been torpedoed by two Italians, who
were in custody. And then the wireless was sent to Paris.</p>

<p>The two officers were taken to the Admiralty and then
placed on the dreadnought <i>Prince Eugene</i>, it being
rumoured that the Italians of Pola intended to rescue
them. Subsequently Koch and other officers, together
with Dr. Stani&#263;, President of the Italian National Council,
went out to see the prisoners. Stani&#263; was left alone with
them for as long as he wished. And when Koch saw them&mdash;he
did not then shake hands&mdash;and asked if they knew
what they had done, "I know it," replied Rossetti rather
arrogantly. Paolucci's demeanour was more modest.</p>

<p>"I was your friend all through the War," said Koch,
"and now you sink our ships. I can only assume that
you were ignorant of what had taken place."</p>

<p>They said that that was so.</p>

<p>"But if you had known," said the Admiral to Rossetti,
"would you have done this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "I am an officer. I had my
orders to blow up the ship and I would have obeyed them."</p>

<p>Koch had undertaken that if it turned out that they
were unaware of the ship's transference to the Yugoslavs
he would kiss them both. He did so, and allowed them
to communicate with Italy by wireless.</p>

<p>Never, says Koch, will the unpleasant taste of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
kisses leave his mouth. The men were officers; their
words could not be doubted. But as they must surely
have been in Venice for at least a day or two before
October 31, it seems extraordinary that they did not
hear, via Triest, of what the Emperor Charles was doing
with his navy. If only they had perfected their invention
and learned to swim a trifle sooner there would be
no shadow cast on their achievement, but the Yugoslavs&mdash;who
had never seen any sort of Italian naval attack
on Pola during the War&mdash;could not be blamed for thinking
that the disappearance of their <i>Viribus Unitis</i> would
be viewed with equanimity by the Italians.... With
regard to the other vessels, it was arranged in Paris that
they should proceed, under the white flag, to Corfu with
Yugoslav commanders; but this was found impossible,
as they were undermanned. Part of the fleet arrived
at Kotor and was placed at the disposal of the commander
of the Yugoslav detachment of the Allied forces
which had come from Macedonia. A serious episode
occurred at Pola, where on November 5 an Italian squadron
arrived and demanded the surrender of the ships. The
Yugoslav commander succeeded in sending by wireless
a strong protest to Paris against this barefaced violation
of the agreement. The Italian commander, Admiral
Cagni, likewise sent a protest, but Clemenceau upheld
the Yugoslavs. They were absolutely masters of the
ex-Austro-Hungarian fleet; it rested solely with them
either to sink it or hand it over to the Allies in good
condition. The Yugoslavs did not sink the fleet, because
they wished to show their loyalty to, and confidence in,
the justice of the Allies. They never suspected at that
time that the ships would not be shared at least equally
between themselves and the Italians. But in December
1919 the Supreme Council in Paris allotted to the Yugoslavs
twelve disarmed torpedo-boats for policing and
patrolling their coasts.</p>


<p class="section">HOW THE ITALIANS LANDED AT POLA</p>

<p>Admiral Cagni was invited by the Yugoslavs to enter
the harbour of Pola. But for two and a half days he hesitated
outside and heavily bombarded the hill-fortress of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Barbarica, which had been abandoned. At last he made
up his mind to risk a landing. The Italian girls of Pola,
dressed in white, came down in a procession to the port;
their arms were full of flowers for the Italian sailors.
And the first men who disembarked were buried in flowers
and kissed and kissed before the girls perceived that, by
a prudent Italian arrangement, this advance guard consisted
of men of the Czecho-Slovak Legion. The first
care of the Italians at Pola was not to ascertain the
whereabouts of the munition depots; they made for the
naval museum, where trophies from the battle of Vis
in 1866 were preserved. These they removed, as well
as whatever took their fancy at the Arsenal. Among
their booty was a silver dinner service which it had been
customary to use on occasions of Imperial visits. An
Italian officer appeared on the <i>Radetzky</i>. Very roughly
he asked an officer who he was. "I am the commander,"
said this first-lieutenant. "No! no!" said the other,
"I am that." But the Italians for the most part avoided
going on board the ships.... Admiral Cagni himself
was very ill at ease, but grew noticeably more confident
as he observed the utter demoralization of Pola. His
correspondence likewise underwent the appropriate
changes. While Koch was in command of 45,000 men,
Cagni wrote to "His Excellency the most illustrious
Signor Ammiraglio"; when the numbers were reduced
to 20,000 the style of address was "Illustrious Signor
Ammiraglio"; when they fell to 10,000 it became "Al
Signor Ammiraglio"; when only 5000 remained a letter
began with the word "Ammiraglio!" and when the
last man had left Pola and Koch was alone, Cagni sent
word through his adjutant that he knew no Admiral
Koch but merely a Signor Koch.</p>


<p class="section">THE SEA-FARING YUGOSLAVS</p>

<p>Talking of numbers, one may mention that the Yugoslavs
formed about 65 per cent. of the Austro-Hungarian
navy, as one would naturally expect from the sea-faring
population of Dalmatia and Istria. In the technical
branches of the service only about 40 per cent. were
Yugoslavs, for a preference was given to Germans and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Magyars. Out of 116 chief engineers only two were
Yugoslavs. Serbo-Croat was an obligatory language;
but German, as in the army, was the language of command.
Thus one sees that, in spite of not being favoured,
the Yugoslavs of the Adriatic, who are natural sailors,
constituted more than half the personnel of the navy.
"These Slav people," writes Mr. Hilaire Belloc,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who
took the trouble to go to the Adriatic with a view to
solving the local problems, "these Slav people have only
tentatively approached the sea. Its traffic was never
native to them." If he had continued a little way down
the coast he would have seen many and many a neat
little house whose owners are retired sea-captains. "They
are not mariners," says Mr. Belloc. If he had made a
small excursion into history he would have learned that
Venice&mdash;since it was to her own advantage&mdash;made an
exception of Dalmatia's shipping industry, and while she
was placing obstacles along the roads that a Dalmatian
might wish to take, allowed the time-honoured industries
of the sea to be developed. Such fine sailors were the
Dalmatians that Benedetto Pesaro, the Venetian Admiral
against the Turks in the fifteenth century, deplored the
fact that his galleys were not fully manned by them,
instead of those "Lombardi" whom he despised. "They
are," says Mr. John Leyland,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the naval authority&mdash;they
are "pre-eminently a maritime race. The circumstances
of their geography, and in a chief degree the wonderful
configuration of their coast-line, with its sheltered
waters and admirable anchorages, made them sea-farers....
The proud Venetians knew them as pirates and
marauders long ago." And "there has never been a
better seaman," adds Mr. Leyland, "than the pirate
turned trader." In 1780 the island of Bra&#269; had forty
vessels, Lussin a hundred, and Kotor, which in the second
half of the eighteenth century quadrupled her mercantile
marine, had a much larger fleet than either of them.
The best-known dockyards were those at Kor&#269;ula and
Trogir, while the great Overseas Sailing Ship Navigation
Company at Peljesac (Sabioncello) occupied an important
position in the world of trade. The company's fleet of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>large sailing vessels was of native construction; both
crews and captains were natives of the country, so that
it was in every way the best representative of the Dalmatian
mercantile marine of the period. When the
Treaty of Vienna in 1815 gave Venice, Istria and the
Eastern Adriatic to the Habsburgs the vessels plying in
those waters were very largely Slav. And with the substitution
of steam the Dalmatians are still holding their
own, with this difference, that the ships are now built,
even as they are manned, not by nobles and the wealthy
<i>bourgeoisie</i>, but by men who come from modest sea-faring
or peasant families. In the Austrian mercantile
marine German capital formed 47&middot;82 per cent., Italian
capital 19&middot;37 per cent. and Slav capital 31&middot;80 per cent.
One of these Dalmatian Slavs, Mihanovi&#263;, going out in
poverty to the Argentine, has followed with such success
the shipbuilding of his ancestors that he is now among
the chief millionaires of Buenos Aires. With regard to
fishing, there are along the Istrian and Dalmatian coast
more than 5000 small vessels which give employment
to 19,000 fishermen, of whom only 1000 are citizens of
Italy. But Mr. Belloc says that these Slav people have
only tentatively approached the sea, that its traffic was
never native to them, and that they are not mariners. It
is marvellous that you can be paid for writing that sort of
stuff.... By Mr. Belloc's side is the Marchese Donghi,
who in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> of June 1922 says: "It is
superfluous to add that everything which has to do with
navigation [in Dalmatia] is entirely in the hands of the
Italians." But I think it is superfluous to contradict a
gentleman who ingenuously believes that Dalmatia is
largely Italian because on our maps we have hitherto
used Italian place-names. Will he say that the population
of Praha is not Czech because on our maps that
capital is commonly called Prague? It pleases the
Marchese to be facetious about what he describes as
"that queer thing called the Srba Hrvata i Slovenca
Kralji (Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes)"; he
should have said "Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca."
He says that in Serbia "no industry is possible," whereas
in one single town, Lescovac, there are no less than
eleven textile besides other factories. He says that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
one-third of the population of Dalmatia is Italian, and
"almost exclusively the nobility and the upper <i>bourgeoisie</i>."
I suppose that is why more than 700 of Dalmatia's leading
citizens were deported by the Italians after the Great
War. He says many other nonsensical things, and sums
it all up by telling us of the "bewildered incomprehension"
of the Adriatic problem!</p>


<p class="section">WHO SET A STANDARD THAT WAS TOO HIGH</p>

<p>Whether rightly or wrongly, the Yugoslavs had formed
their opinion of the Italian sailors, an opinion which dated
from the time of Tegetthoff and had not undergone much
modification by the incidents of this War. They remembered
what had happened when they cruised outside
Italian ports; they knew very probably that the British
had on more than one occasion to break through the
boom outside Taranto harbour, and they may have read<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
of the experience of some French ladies who came to the
Albanian coast on the <i>Citt&agrave; di Bari</i> towards the end of
1915 with 2000 kilos of milk, clothing and medical supplies
for the Serbian children who had struggled across the
mountains. These ladies write that after the torpedoing
of the <i>Brindisi</i> their own crew ran up and down without
appearing to see them; the crew had life-belts, those
of the ladies were taken away. Ultimately they succeeded
in having themselves put ashore, and the <i>Citt&agrave; di
Bari</i> fled in the night without landing the stores. And
in Albania, the ladies say, one witnessed the "stoic
endurance of the noble Serbian race, of which every day
brought us more examples. In that procession of ghosts
and of the dying there was no imploring look, there was
no hand stretched out to beg." ... The Yugoslavs may
have known what happened to Lieutenant (now Captain)
Binnos de Pombara of the French navy. This officer,
in command of the <i>Fourche</i>, had been escorting the <i>Citt&agrave;
di Messina</i> and, observing that she was torpedoed, had
sent to her, perhaps a little imprudently, all his life-boats
and belts. A few minutes later, when he was himself
torpedoed, the Italians did not see him; anyhow they
made for the shore. De Pombara encouraged his men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>by causing them to sing the Marseillaise and so forth;
they were in the water, clinging to the wreckage, for
several hours, until another boat came past. The next
day at Brindisi, when he met the captain of the <i>Citt&agrave; di
Messina</i>, this gentleman once more did not see him;
but the French Government, although de Pombara was
a very young man, created him an officer of the Legion
of Honour.</p>


<p class="section">AN ELECTRICAL ATMOSPHERE AND NO PRECAUTIONS</p>

<p>There was thus a certain amount of tension existing
between the military and naval services of the Yugoslavs
and those of Italy. Other Yugoslavs were apprehensive
as to whether the Italians would not demand the enforcement
of the Treaty of London. But the United
States was not bound by that agreement, which was so
completely at variance with Wilson's principle of self-determination.
One presumed that, pending an examination
of these matters, the disputed territories would be
occupied by troops of all the Allies. But unfortunately
this did not turn out to be the case. France, Britain
and America stood by, while the Italians and the Yugoslavs
took whatsoever they could lay their hands on. As the
Yugoslav military forces had to come overland, while
the Italians had command of the sea, it was natural
that in most places the Italians got the better of the
scramble; and where they found the Yugoslavs in possession,
as at Rieka, they usually ousted them by diplomatic
methods. And in one way or another they managed to
make their holdings tally, as far as possible, with the
Treaty of London, and even to go beyond it. Baron
Sonnino declined to make a comprehensive statement
as to the Italian programme. Of course he desired in
the end to exchange Dalmatia&mdash;the seizure of which
would entail a war with Yugoslavia&mdash;against Rieka.
But as Italian public opinion had scarcely thought of
Rieka during the War, he made it his business to cause
them to yearn for that town. His compatriots were
asking why Mr. Wilson's Fourteen Points should be waived
for France in the Sarre Basin, for Britain in Ireland and
Egypt, but not for them. And some of his would-be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ingenious compatriots pointed out&mdash;their contentions
were embodied in the Italian Memorandum to the Supreme
Council on January 10, 1920&mdash;that as the Treaty of London
was based on the presumption that Montenegro, Serbia
and Croatia would remain separate States, this instrument
had been altogether upset by the merging of those
Southern Slavs into one country, Yugoslavia; it followed,
therefore, that the Treaty which attributed Rieka to
the Croats could no longer be invoked. But the other
parts of the Treaty which gave the Slav mainland and
islands to Italy were absolutely unassailable. The
reader will resent being troubled by this kind of balderdash,
but Messrs. Clemenceau, Lloyd-George and Wilson
may have resented it even more.</p>


<p class="section">ITALIAN MILDNESS ON THE ISLE OF VIS</p>

<p>On November 3 the Italians arrived outside Vis
(Lissa), the most westerly of the large islands, where
the entire population of 11,000 is Slav, except for the
family of an honoured inhabitant, Dr. Doimi, and three
other families related to his. Dr. Doimi's people have
lived for many years on this island&mdash;his father was mayor
of the capital, which is also called Vis, for half a century&mdash;and
now they have become so acclimatized that, as
he told me, three of his four nephews prefer to call themselves
Yugoslavs. This phenomenon can be seen all
down the Adriatic coast. It has often, for example,
been pointed out to Dr. Vio, the very Italian ex-mayor
of Rieka, that he has a Croat father and several Croat
brothers. Thus also the Duimi&#263; family of the same town
has one brother married to a Magyar lady and very fond
of the Magyars, a second brother who is a Professor at
Milan, and a third who lives above Rieka and is a Yugoslav.
The terms "Yugoslav" and "Italian" have now come
to signify not what a man is, but what he wants to be,
applying thus the admirable principle of self-determination.
Well, in the old days on the isle of Vis between
two and three hundred people belonged to the Autonomist
party, owing to their great regard for Dr. Doimi; but
these say now that they are Yugoslavs, and the Italians&mdash;at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
all events Captain Sportiello, their chief officer at
Vis&mdash;acknowledged that they must base their demand on
strategic reasons. A day or two before the Italians
arrived the population had arrested several Austrian
functionaries, including the mayor and three gendarmes,
who had maltreated them during the War. None of these
persons were Italian; and when the Italian boats were
sighted a committee went to meet them joyfully and
brought the officers ashore upon their backs. The
officers explained that they had come as representatives
of the Entente and the United States, and for the object&mdash;which
appeared superfluous&mdash;of protecting Vis from
German submarines. If the Italians had been everywhere
as inoffensive as at Vis, it would be more agreeable to
write about their doings. Captain Sportiello, a naval
officer, showed himself throughout the months of his
administration to be sensible; he frequented Yugoslav
houses. The greatest divergence occurred on June 1,
1919, when the Italians planned to have a demonstration
for their national holiday, and asked the inhabitants to
come to the bioscope, where they would be regaled with
cakes and sweets; the inhabitants replied that they
preferred to have Yugoslavia.... But there is a monument
in the cemetery at Vis to which I must refer. It
is a very fine monument of white marble, erected by the
Austrians to commemorate their victory in these waters
over the Italian navy in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> On the top there is a
lion clutching the Italian flag, while on two of the sides
there are inscriptions in the German language. One of
them, some feet in length, relates that this memorial is
placed there for the officers and men who on July 20,
1866, gave their lives in the service of their Emperor
and country. The Italians screwed two marble slabs
across the upper and the lower parts of this inscription, so
that the German lettering of the central part remained
visible; on the lower slab one read: "Novembre 1918"
and on the upper one "Italia Vincitrice" (Victorious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Italy). We were taken by several Italian officers to look
at this. They were so proud of it that they presented us
with photographs of the monument in its altered state.
I fear that the Italian mentality escapes me. I should
not have written anything about them.</p>


<p class="section">THEIR TRUCULENCE AT KOR&#268;ULA</p>

<p>They landed on the same day, November 3, on the
beautiful and prosperous island of Kor&#269;ula (Curzola),
putting ashore at Velaluka, the western harbour. With
the exception of five families, all the people are Yugoslavs;
and the Italians, who sailed in under a white flag,
announced that they had come as friends of the Yugoslavs
and of the Entente, to preserve order and to protect
them against submarines. On the 5th, they went to
the town of Kor&#269;ula, where one of the two officers,
Lieutenant Poggi, of the navy, put his assurances in
writing, as he had done at Velaluka. He protested
against the word "Occupation." On the 7th they returned
to Velaluka and on the 12th went back, with
about a hundred men, to Kor&#269;ula. Once more he wrote
that he had not come to occupy the island; he added,
though, that the district officials should act on the
opposite peninsula of Sabioncello in the name of the Yugoslavs,
but over Kor&#269;ula and the island of Lastovo (Lagosta)
in the name of Italy&mdash;not of the Entente. He wanted
to remove the Yugoslav flags from public buildings and
substitute Italian flags. When he was reminded of what
he had said with regard to the Entente, he exclaimed:
"No, no! This is Italy!" The chief district official
protested, and refused to carry out Lieut. Poggi's injunctions,
nor were the Italians able to do so. This officer
remained at Kor&#269;ula, requisitioning houses and hoisting
as many Italian flags as he could. He issued an order
that after 6.30 p.m. not more than three persons were
allowed to come together in the streets. His men used
to offer food to the women of the place, who declined it;
after which the food was given to the children, who were
previously photographed in an imploring attitude. There
was some trouble on December 15 when the <i>Leonidas</i>,
an American ship, came in with a number of mine-sweepers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Apparently the Yugoslavs contravened the Italian regulations
by omitting to ask whether their band might play
in the harbour, but, on the supposition that this would
not be accorded to them, went down to the harbour just
as if they were not living under regulations. They
waved American, Serbian and Croatian flags, all of which
the Italians attempted to seize; the most gorgeous one,
a Yugoslav flag of silk with gilt fringes, they tore up
and divided among themselves as a trophy. When the
<i>Leonidas</i> made fast, a lieutenant leaped ashore and
placed himself, holding a revolver, in front of an American
flag. The captain, according to some reports, had his
men standing to their guns, while others of the crew are
said to have been given hand-grenades; but whether
by this method or another, the turbulence on shore was
calmed and the Italians seem to have invited the captain
to step off his boat. He preferred, however, to go to
another port; the populace came overland. One need
not say that there was jollification.... When the other
American boats departed, a small one remained at
Kor&#269;ula. One day a steamer came from Metkovi&#263;,
having on board a few men of the Yugoslav Legion.
The people of Kor&#269;ula, not being allowed to take the
men to their houses, came down quietly to the harbour
with coffee and bread, but the carabinieri drove them
away. These legionaries were emigrants to Australia
and Canada, who had come back to fight for the Entente,
including Italy. The Italians wanted to arrest them all
on account of a small Croatian flag which one of them
was holding, but at the request of the American ship
they refrained. A certain Marko &#352;imunovi&#263;, who had
gone to Australia from the Kor&#269;ula village of Ra&#269;i&#353;ca,
went over to speak to the sailors on the American boat.
Because of this the carabinieri took him to the military
headquarters. He was interned for several months in
Italy.</p>

<p>The long island of Hvar (Lesina) was not occupied
until November 13. It is interesting, by the by, to note
how this island came to have its names. In the time of
the Greek colonists it was known as &#8001; &#966;&#7937;&#961;&#959;&#962;, which subsequently
became Farra or Quarra, leading to the name
Hvar, by which it is known to the Slavs. They also,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in the thirteenth century, gave it an alternative name:
Lesna, from the Slav word signifying "wooded," for
the Venetians had not yet despoiled the island of many of
its forests. Lesna was the popular and Hvar the literary
name; and the Italians, taking the former of these,
coined the word Lesina, the sound of which makes many
of them and of other people think that this is an Italian
island.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The question of Slav and Italian geographical
names in Dalmatia has been carefully investigated by a
student at Split. Taking the zone which was made over
to the Italians by the Treaty of London, he found that
with the exception of a reef called Maon, alongside the
island of Pago, every island, village, mountain and river
has a Slav name, whereas out of the total of 114 names
there were 64 which have no names in Italian; and
this is giving the Italians credit for such words as Sebenico,
Zemonico and so forth, which in the opinion of philologists
are merely modifications of the original &#352;ibenik, Zemunik,
etc.</p>


<p class="section">AND ON HVAR</p>

<p>At Starigrad on Hvar the Italians also said that they
were representatives of the Entente, but soon they prohibited
the national colours. Being perhaps aware that
in the whole island, with its population of about 20,000,
there were before the War only four or five Italians who
were engaged in selling fruit, their countrymen in November
1918 did their best, by the distribution of other
commodities&mdash;rice, flour and macaroni&mdash;to make some
more Italians. They succeeded at Starigrad in obtaining
fifteen or twenty recruits. And they made it obvious
that it would be more comfortable to be an Italian than
a Yugoslav. The local Reading-Rooms, whose committee
had received no previous warning, fell so greatly under
the displeasure of the Italians that one night after ten
o'clock&mdash;at which time curfew sounded for the Yugoslavs;
the Italians and their friends could stay out until
any hour&mdash;the premises were sacked: knives were used
against the pictures, furniture was taken by assault, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>mirrors did not long resist the fine &eacute;lan of the attacking
party. Old vases, other ornaments and books were
thrown into the harbour near the <i>Sirio</i>, the Italian destroyer
which was anchored ten yards from the Reading-Rooms.
Of course there was an inquiry; the result of
it was that several Yugoslavs (and no others) were imprisoned.
The <i>Sirio's</i> commander was a gentleman of
some activity; he sent a telegram to Rome and another
one to Admiral Millo, the Italian Governor of the occupied
parts of Dalmatia, saying that the people of the island
longed for annexation. These telegrams he read aloud
before the islanders, with all his carabinieri in attendance....
The old-world capital of the island, which is a
smaller place than Starigrad, was occupied on the same
day. The first serious encounter took place on December
4, when the Italians, who were quartered on the upper
floor of the Sokol or gymnastic club, observed that furniture
was being taken from the rooms below them and was
being carried out into the street. If they had asked the
people what they were about they would have heard
that these things had been stored in the gymnasium during
the War and that the place was now to be devoted to its
original purpose. What they did was to believe at once
the yarn of a renegade, who told them that the people
were preparing to blow up the house. The Italians
opened fire, wounded several persons and killed one of
their own carabinieri.</p>


<p class="section">HOW THEY WERE RECEIVED AT ZADAR</p>

<p>On the mainland the Italians were received at &#352;ibenik
with some suspicion. They announced, however, that
they came as representatives of the Allies, and begged for
a pilot who would take them into &#352;ibenik's land-locked
harbour, through the mine-field. The Yugoslavs consented,
and after the Italians had installed themselves
they requisitioned sixty Austrian merchant vessels which
were lying in that harbour. (They left, as a matter of
fact, to the Yugoslavs out of all the ex-Austrian mercantile
fleet exactly four old boats&mdash;<i>Sebenico</i>, <i>Lussin</i>, <i>Mossor</i>
and <i>Dinara</i>&mdash;with a total displacement of 390 tons.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
On the other hand, at Zadar, they were received in a very
friendly fashion. In this town, as it had been the seat
of government, with numerous officials and their families,
the Autonomist anti-Croat party had been, under Austria,
more powerful than in any other town in Dalmatia. With
converts coming in from the country, which is entirely
Slav, the Autonomists in Zadar had become well over half
the population,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which is about 14,000, that of the surrounding
district being about 23,000. Zadar was thus a
place apart from the rest of Dalmatia, and although the
Dalmatian Autonomists were unable to claim any of the
eleven deputies who went to Vienna, they managed to be
represented in the provincial Chamber&mdash;the Landtag&mdash;by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>six out of the forty-one members. The Landtag was not
elected on the basis of universal suffrage; four out of these
six members were chosen by large landowners, one (Dr.
Ziliotto, the mayor) by the town of Zadar and one by
the Zadar chamber of commerce. Out of the eighty-six
communes of Dalmatia, Zadar was the solitary one that
was Autonomist. Some very few Autonomists were wont
to say that they aspired to union with Italy, but it was
generally thought that most of them agreed with Dr.
Ziliotto when he said in the Landtag in 1906: "We,
separated from Italy by the whole Adriatic&mdash;we a few
thousand men, scattered, with no territorial links, among
a population not of hundreds of thousands but of millions
of Slavs, how could we think of union with Italy?"
And Dr. Ziliotto was one of those who always regarded
himself as an Italian. But whether the Zadar Autonomists
were sincere or not when Austria ruled over them, the
large majority of them hung out Italian colours after the
War, and in this they were undoubtedly sincere, although
the motives varied; in some it was the love of Italy, in
some it was ambition and in some a thirst for vengeance.</p>

<p>[Although both Yugoslavs and Italians criticize the
Austrian figures, it is probable that they are pretty
accurate. The census of 1910 gave for Dalmatia:
610,669 Serbo-Croats, 18,028 Italians, 3081 Germans and
1410 Czecho-Slovaks. The Autonomist party claimed
that they were not 18,028 but 30,000; and that 150,000
persons in Dalmatia speak Italian. But the Orlando-Sonnino
Government really did try its utmost to improve
these figures. At the end of November 1918 the Italians,
who had charge of the police at Constantinople, put up
notices asking all Austrian subjects from Dalmatia to
inscribe themselves with the authorities and thus receive
protection. In addition to the ordinary large Yugoslav
population, the Austrian army was still there, and two
of its officers, in uniform, inscribed themselves. The
Italians had to endure not a few rebuffs, for they applied
to people at their houses&mdash;they had found the nationality
lists at the police offices. The Dutch were looking after
Yugoslav interests, but received no instructions.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">WHAT THEY DID THERE</p>

<p>It was thought at Zadar that the Italians would be
followed in the course of days by the other Allies. Anyhow
the Yugoslavs were in no carping spirit; about 5000
of them assembled to greet the Italian destroyer; they
were, in fact, more numerous than the Italians. And
perhaps one should record that on this memorable occasion&mdash;it
was at an early hour&mdash;Dr. Ziliotto had to complete
his toilette as he ran down to the quay. Soon the Italian
captain, shouldered by the crowd, was flourishing two
flags, the Italian and the Yugoslav&mdash;although his country
had, of course, not recognized Yugoslavia. For a little
time it was the colour of roses, and the worm that crept
into this paradise seems to have been a Japanese warship
in whose presence each of the two parties wished to demonstrate
how powerful it was. The carabinieri resolved
to maintain order, and as an inmate of the seminary
made, they said, an unpolished gesture at them from a
window they went off and, with some reinforcements,
broke into the Slav Reading-Room and damaged it considerably.
The Italian officers and men at Zadar went
about their duties for some time without permitting
themselves to be drawn into local politics, but they were
told repeatedly that the Slavs are goats and barbarians,
so that at last the men appear to have concluded that
strong measures were required. Some of them mingled,
in civilian clothes, with the unruly elements, and Zadar's
narrow streets became most hazardous for Yugoslav
pedestrians. Girls and men alike were roughly handled;
thrice in one day, for example, a professor&mdash;Dr. Stoikevi&#263;&mdash;had
his ears boxed as he went to or was coming from his
school. Yet Zadar is a dignified old place; the chief
men of the town and the Italian officers did what they
could to keep it so. But away from their control some
deeds of truculence occurred. The prison warders, as
the spirit moved them, forced the Slavs there to be quiet,
or to shout "Viva Italia!" Most of the Slavs were in
the gaol for having had in their possession Austrian paper
money stamped by the Yugoslav authorities; these notes
were subsequently declared by the Italians to be illegal;
but if a man came from Croatia, for example, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nothing else, it was a trifle harsh to lock him up and confiscate
the money. Eight good people went to Zadar
prison owing to the fact that near the ancient town of
Biograd they had been sitting underneath the olive trees
and singing Croat folk-songs. Nor was it much in keeping
with Zadar's dignity when the "Ufficio Propaganda" put
out a large red placard which invited boys between the
ages of nine and seventeen to join in establishing a "Corpo
Nazionale dei giovani esploratori"&mdash;that is to say, an association
of boy scouts. It is superfluous to inquire as to
why these boys were mustered.... When the Austrians
collapsed, a few old rifles were seized by the Italians and
the Croats, the latter having fifteen or twenty which they
hid in various villages. A priest and a medical student
were privy to this fearful crime. A hue and cry was
raised by the carabinieri&mdash;the priest vanished, the student
jumped out of a window of his house and also vanished.
But the carabinieri would not be denied. They suspected
that the Albanians of the neighbouring village of Borgo
Erizzo were abetting the Slavs. It was necessary, therefore,
to castigate them. The 2500 inhabitants of Borgo
Erizzo, nearly all of them Albanians who speak their own
language and Serbo-Croat, while 5 per cent. also speak
Italian, used to be divided in their sympathies before the
War&mdash;75 per cent. being adherents of the Slavs in Zadar
and 25 per cent. of the Autonomists. Now they have,
excepting 5 per cent., gone over to the Slavs, and as they
have retained some of the habits of their ancestors, they
were not going to let the hostile forces win an easy victory.
A student marched in front of the Italians, then about
ten carabinieri, then a few ranks of soldiers, and then the
mob of Zadar. The Albanians were in two groups, twenty
sheltering behind walls to the right of the road and twenty
to the left; they were armed with stones, their women
folk were bringing them relays of these. The encounter
ended in three carabinieri and seven or eight soldiers
being wounded. In order to avenge this defeat one
Duka, who is by birth an Albanian and is a teacher at
the Italian "Liga" school, which was built a few years
ago at Borgo Erizzo, determined on the next afternoon to
attack the Teachers' Institute, which is situated 400 steps
from his own establishment, and which on the previous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
day had shown a strong defence. He led the attack in
person, firing his revolver. But the casualties were light.
The Teachers' Institute was, after this, occupied by the
military, and Admiral Millo paid a complimentary visit to
Duka at his school.</p>


<p class="section">PRETTY DOINGS AT KRK</p>

<p>Proceeding up the Adriatic we come to the Quarnero
Islands, of which the most considerable is Krk (Veglia).
The whole district had, at the last census, 19,562 inhabitants
whose ordinary language was Serbo-Croat, and 1544 who
commonly spoke Italian. Of these latter the capital,
likewise called Krk, contained 1494, and only 644 who
gave themselves out as Slavs. The town, with its tortuous,
rather wistful streets, was the residence of the Venetian
officials, and five or six of those old families remain. The
rest of the 1494 are nearly all Italianized Slavs, who under
Austria used to call themselves either Austrians of Italian
tongue or else Istrians. However, if they wish to be
Italians now, there is none to say them nay. They
include five out of the twenty officials, and these five
gentlemen seem to have boldly said before the War that
it would please them if this island were to be included in
the Kingdom of Italy. They did not give their Austrian
rulers many sleepless nights; this confidence in them was
justified, for during the War they placed themselves in
the front rank of those who flung defiant words at Italy,
and one of them enlarged his weapon, copying upon his
typewriter some Songs of Hate, which probably were sent
to him from Rieka or Triest. These typewritten sheets
were then circulated in the island. One of them&mdash;"Con
le teste degli Italiani"&mdash;had been specially composed for
children and expressed the intention of playing bowls
with Italian heads. The songs for adults were less blood-thirsty
but not less cruel. The Yugoslavs of the island
must have been engaged in other War work; no songs
were provided for them.... When Austria collapsed,
some youths came from Rieka, flourishing their flags and
sticks, and crying, "Down with Austria!" "Long live
Italy!" "Long live Yugoslavia!" "Long live King
Peter!" There was, in fact general goodwill. A Croat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
National Council was formed, and was recognized by the
Italian party; it introduced a censorship, but as the
postmaster's allegiance was given to the minority he sent
a telegram to Triest, asking for bread and protection;
and on November 15 the <i>Stocco</i> arrived. Other people
soon departed; the Bishop's chancellor and his chaplain,
two magistrates and a Custom-house official, were shipped
off to Italy or Sardinia, while the owner of the typewriter
flew off as a delegate to Paris, having persuaded the town
council of the capital to vote a sum of 36,000 crowns for
his expenses&mdash;but a crown was now worth less than half a
franc. However, two members of the town council thought
that it was a waste of money; but when they were
threatened with internment in Sardinia they withdrew
their active opposition, and the delegate set out. On the
way he granted an interview to an Italian journalist, and
depicted the spontaneous enthusiasm with which the
islanders had called for Italy. But the journalist had
heard of the National Council and he asked, very naturally,
whether it shared these sentiments. "Ha parlato da
Italiano!" ("I have spoken as an Italian"), replied the
delegate; and when the newspaper reached the island,
this cryptic saying was interpreted in various ways, his
critics pointing out that, as he had diverged from truthfulness,
this was another little Song of Hate. The Bishop,
Dr. Mahni&#263;,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> did not go to Italy for several months. He
was a learned Slovene, an ex-Professor of Gorica University,
known also as a stern critic of any poetry which was
not dogmatically religious. He gave vent to his dislike
of the poetry of Gregor&#269;i&#263; and A&#353;kerc, both of them
priests. The former, being of a mild disposition, bowed
before the storm; but A&#353;kerc wrote a cutting satire on
his critic. The Austrians, disapproving of his religious
and patriotic activities, thought they would smother him
by this appointment to a rather out-of-the-way diocese.
But his influence spread far beyond it, and in the islands
he was so solicitous for the people's material welfare
that, for example, he founded savings-banks, which were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>a great success. It was unavoidable, as he was a man of
character, that he should come into conflict with the
Italians, for their commanding officer, a naval captain
of Hungarian origin, was not a suave administrator. He
charged a priest with making Yugoslav propaganda
because he catechized the little children in their own
language; another priest on the island of Unie, which
forms a part of the diocese, was accused of making propaganda,
because he has had in his church two statues&mdash;which
had been there for years&mdash;of SS. Cyril and
Methodus. They were removed from the church, he put
them back; finally he was himself expelled and Unie
remained without a priest. The naval captain was
irritated by the old Slavonic liturgy, which is used in all
except four churches of the diocese, but if he could not
alter this&mdash;Dr. Mahni&#263; referring him to the Pope&mdash;he and
the Admiral at Pola, Admiral Cagni, could manage with
some trouble to rid themselves of the bishop. This
gentleman, who was in his seventieth year and an invalid,
said that he would perhaps go to Rome after Easter.
On March 24 the captain told him that the admiral had
settled he should sail in three days, but the bishop was
ill. On the 26th the captain returned with a lieutenant
of carabinieri to ask if the bishop was still ailing; the
admiral, it seemed, had ordered that two other doctors&mdash;the
officer of health for the district and an Italian army
doctor&mdash;should verify the report of the bishop's own
medical attendant. The three of them quarrelled for
two hours, but finally they all signed a memorandum that
the bishop was ill. On the 31st the captain came to say
that a destroyer would arrive and that it would take the
bishop wherever he wanted to go, for the Italians had
made up their minds that go he must. He had objected
far too vigorously to their methods&mdash;not approving, for
example, of the written permit which was given in the
autumn to the people of two villages in Krk, on which it
stated that these people could supply themselves with
timber at Grdnje. This was a State forest, rented by a
certain man; but the Italians acknowledged that what they
wanted was adherents, and these grateful villagers, if
there should be a plebiscite, would vote for them. The
man appealed to justice, but the judge received a verbal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
order not to act. The villagers were given a general amnesty
on January 1, an Italian flag was hoisted at the judge's
office&mdash;the judge had gone away. Another transaction
which the bishop had resented was after a visit paid by
the captain and another officer of the French warship
<i>Annamite</i> to the Yugoslav Reading-Rooms at Lo&#353;inj mali
(Lussinpiccolo); a priest and two other gentlemen had
escorted their guests to the harbour at 11 p.m.; during
the night all three were arrested and the priest deported.
When the <i>Annamite</i> put in at the lofty island of Cres
(Cherso) and a couple of officers went to the Franciscan
monastery, it resulted in the monastery being closed and
the monks removed. Their simple act of courtesy was,
said the Italians, propaganda. From Lo&#353;inj mali and
Cres five ladies were collected, four of them being teachers
and one the wife of the pilot, Sindi&#269;i&#263;. They were guilty
of having greeted the French, and on account of this were
taken to the prison at Pola. Afterwards in Venice they
were kept for six weeks in the company of prostitutes
and from there they passed to Sardinia, on which island
they were retained for nine months. As for Dr. Mahni&#263;,
he set sail on April 4 at 6 a.m. Being asked whither he
would like to go, he said he wished to be put down at
Zengg on the mainland. "Excellent," said the Italians;
but after a few minutes they said they had received a
radio from Pola that the bishop must be taken to Ancona.
He was afterwards allowed to live in a monastery near
Rome.</p>


<p class="section">UNHAPPY POLA</p>

<p>The Italians had not been two days in Pola&mdash;in which
arsenal town the population, unlike that of the country,
mostly uses the Italian language&mdash;when they made
themselves disliked by both parties. The President of
the Italian National Council was told by the Admiral that
an Austrian crown was to be worth forty Italian centesimi.
This, said the Admiral, was an order from Rome. The
President explained that this meant ruin for the people
of the town. He asked if he might telegraph to Rome.
"I am Rome!" said the Admiral, or words to that effect.
Thereupon the President and the colleagues who were
with him said they would never come again to see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Admiral "If I want you," said the Admiral, "I will
have you brought by a couple of carabinieri." On the
next day red flags were flying on the arsenal and on the
day after the Italian troops were taken elsewhere, while
10,000 fresh ones came from Italy. And Pola, in exchange
for troops, gave coal. For some time the Italians carried
off two trainloads of it every day. This absence of coal
from their own native country, which rather places them
at the mercy of the coal-producing lands, seems to be
more their misfortune than anybody's fault, yet the
Italian party of Rieka added this to their grievances
against France and Great Britain. Those two countries
ought, they said, in very decency, to correct the oversights
of Providence; but no very practical suggestions
were put forward.</p>


<p class="section">WHAT ISTRIA ENDURED</p>

<p>According to the Austrian census of 1910 Istria contained
386,740 inhabitants, of whom 218,854 (or 58&middot;5 per
cent.) habitually used the Serbo-Croat language, while
145,552 (or 38&middot;9 per cent.) used Italian. The Yugoslavs
cannot help regarding the Istrian statistics with suspicion,
and believing that here, more than in Dalmatia, they were
made to suffer on account of Austria's alliance with Italy
and with the Vatican: one of the wrongs which Strossmayer
fought against was that Istria had been entrusted
to an Italian Dalmatian bishop who could not speak a
word of Slav. This prelate appointed to vacant livings
a number of Italian priests whom the people could not
understand; a Slav coming to confess had to be supplied
with an interpreter. As to the statistics in the commune
of Krmed (Carmedo), for example, of the district of Pola,
the census of 1900 gave 257 Croats against three Italians,
whereas in 1910 it was stated that 296 inhabitants spoke
habitually Italian and six spoke Croatian. Nevertheless,
if one accepts the Austrian figures, the 58&middot;5 per cent.
should not be treated as if they did not exist. Perhaps
the Italian officials could find no interpreters to translate
their proclamations and decrees; if the Yugoslavs could
not read them that was a defect in their education. If
they were unable to write to the authorities or to send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
private telegrams in Italian, let them hold their peace.
At any rate, said Vice-Admiral Cagni, we will not encourage
the Croatian language, and on November 16, 1918,
he commanded the Yugoslav schools to be shut at eleven
places in the district and also two schools in the town.
The Austrians had allowed these schools to remain open
during the War; but of course if you wish to prevent
people from learning a language this is one of the first
steps you would take. Thirteen Yugoslav schoolmasters
at Pola were thus deprived of their means of livelihood.
The Admiral said that he really did not want to let matters
remain in this condition, but all these schools had been
at the expense of the State; let the Yugoslavs support
their own schools. They were, as a matter of fact, entitled
by reason of their numbers to have State-supported
schools. Yet that was, of course, in the time of Austria;
and why should Italy be bound by Austrian laws? Italy
would do what she saw fit. In various places the teachers
were, in the presence of Italian officers, compelled to use
Italian for the instruction of purely Yugoslav children.
Slav schoolmistresses were, in several cases, taken out of
bed in the middle of the night and conducted on board
Italian ships. The clergy were ordered to preach in
Italian in churches, such as that of Veprinac, where the
congregation is almost entirely Slav<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;and so on, and so
on. Well, there are several ways of governing a mixed
population, and this is one of them.... "Zadar and
Rieka," said Pribi&#269;evi&#263; in November to an Italian interviewer
at Zagreb&mdash;"Zadar and Rieka will enjoy all liberty
of culture and municipal autonomy. And we are convinced
that an equal treatment will be accorded to the
Slav minorities who will be included in your territory.
We understand and perfectly recognize your right to Triest
and to Pola, and we would that in Italy our right to Rieka
and Dalmatia were recognized with the same justice."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p class="section">THE FAMOUS TOWN OF RIEKA</p>

<p>Rieka is a place concerning which a good deal has
been written, but I doubt if there have been two words
more striking than the phrase which the Consiglio Nazionale
Italiano applies in a pamphlet to the last Hungarian
Governor. This official, appreciating that his presence
in the town would serve no useful end, dissolved the State
police on October 28, 1918, and departed. "H&ocirc;te
insalu&eacute;, il disparut...." says the pamphlet. After all
the years of kindness, all the million favours showered
on the Autonomists by their beloved friends the Magyars,
after all the dark electioneering tricks and gutter legislation
which for years had been committed by the Magyars
to the end that the Autonomists and they should have all
the amenities of some one else's house, it surely is the
acme of ingratitude to call this tottering benefactor
"H&ocirc;te insalu&eacute;." If the Autonomists did not desire to
reap advantages from any Magyar corruption, they might
at any time since November 17, 1868, have torn the
swindling piece of paper, the "krpitsa," from the Agreement
made between the Magyars and the Croats. Then
the Croat would not have been kept for all these years a
slave in his own home.... But on October 28, 1918,
the "krpitsa" had no more weight, the iniquitous Agreement
was obsolete, the Croats came into possession of
their own. The Compromise of 1868, which gave the
administration of Rieka provisionally to the Magyars,
was formally denounced on October 29, so that the
<i>status quo ante</i> returned, and Rieka was again an integral
part of the Kingdom of Croatia. The Croatian Government
(that is, the National Council) had then every right
to depute its adherents at Rieka to undertake the affairs
of that town. Dr. Vio was too much of a lawyer to dispute
the legality of any of these statements....</p>


<p class="section">THE DRAMA BEGINS</p>

<p>Some of the leading citizens of Rieka formed themselves
into a Croat National Council; Dr. Bakar&#269;i&#263; and
Dr. Lenac went up to the Governor's palace, and with
them went Dr. Vio, as delegate of the town council. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
said they recognized the Croatian Government, on condition
that the town's municipal autonomy was guaranteed.
To this they readily consented, with respect to the Italian
language, to their schools and to the existing town administration,
thus agreeing to every suggestion which Dr.
Vio made. Moreover they gave him the town register
(of births, etc.), which the Magyars had appropriated
and which was now discovered at the palace. This was
at 9 a.m. on October 30. Dr. Vio said that he was glad
that everything had been arranged so amicably. But on
the same evening the Italian National Council elected
itself, for a large number of the Autonomist party had
now become the Italian party. There still remained,
however, an Autonomist party, which was no longer
inspired, like the old Autonomists, by despotic sentiments
towards the Croats, but by a feeling that in consequence
of this long despotism the Croats were, as yet, not fit to
govern such a place as Rieka. This is a matter of opinion.
These Autonomists considered that, at any rate for several
years, the town should not belong to Yugoslavia or to
Italy, but be a free town under Allied, British or American,
control. After five or six years there could be a plebiscite,
and during that period the population would be encouraged
to devote itself more to business and less to politics. This
would tend to make them a united people, with the
interests of the town at heart. But the Italian party,
said the Autonomist leader, Mr. Gothardi, did not appear
to think these interests important; when it was argued
that Rieka would not flourish under Italy, because of
the competition with Italy's other ports and especially
Triest, because of the vast Italian debt, and for other
reasons, the Italian party answered that even if the grass
grew in Rieka's streets it must belong to Italy. "Very
well," said the Slavs, "then we will develop the harbour
at Bakar" a few miles away. "Infamous idea!"
exclaimed the Italianists; "Rieka is the harbour for
the hinterland." There the Autonomists agree with them,
that the town should finally belong to the State which
has the hinterland. Mr. Gothardi's party gathered strength
and he himself became so obnoxious to the Italianists
that when I saw him in the month of May 1919 he had
been for several weeks a prisoner in his flat, on account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of some thirty individuals with sticks who were lurking
round the corner. His figures were as follows:</p>


<table summary="statistics">
<tr><td style="text-align: right">6,000</td><td style="text-align: left">Socialists.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">3,000</td><td style="text-align: left">Autonomists.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">1,500</td><td style="text-align: left">Yugoslavs.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right; line-height: 25%">&mdash;&mdash;</td><td style="line-height: 25%">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">That is, 10,000</td><td>voters out of 12-13,000.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>One may mention that he, like some others of his party,
belongs to a family which has been at Rieka for two
hundred years, whereas of the fifteen gentlemen who
called themselves the Italian National Council, only one&mdash;a
cousin of Mr. Gothardi's&mdash;is a member of an old
Rieka family. Most of the others we are bound to call
renegades.</p>

<p>It may be asked why the Italian National Council
was established, and why its members swore that they
would give their lives if they could thus give Rieka to
the "Madre Patria." Some of them believed, I am sure,
that this was for Rieka's good, cultural and economical;
others entertained the motives that we saw at Zadar&mdash;personal
ambition and the desire to satisfy some animosities.
And there were others who remembered what
occurred in the great harbour warehouses. They hoped,
they thought that if the town fell to the lot of Italy no
questions would be asked.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There must also have been
some who could not bear to contemplate the loss of their
old privileged position.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p class="section">THE I.N.C.</p>

<p>For a considerable time it was not known who were
the members of the Italian National Council. From
internal evidence one saw that they were not particularly
logical people, for they made much play, in their announcements,
with "democratic principles" in spite of the
undemocratic fog in which they wrapped themselves.
Of course they had not been elected by anyone except
themselves; but there was a vast difference between
them and the self-elected Croat National Council, since
the latter derived their authority from the Croatian
Government at Zagreb, which Dr. Vio, in the name of the
Rieka municipality, had recognized&mdash;whereas the Italian
National Council was destitute of any parent, though they
would, had they been pressed, have claimed, no doubt,
the blissfully unconscious "Madre Patria." Subsequently
it turned out that the I.N.C. consisted of Dr. Vio and of
fourteen persons who had hitherto not taken part in
public life. They were fourteen worthies of the background,
the most remarkable act in the life of their President,
Dr. Grossich, for example, dating from twenty
years ago when he was the medical attendant of the
Archduchess Clothilde, and decorated, so <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'thay'">they</ins> say, his
consulting-room with black and yellow festoons. The
I.N.C. appeared at its inception to be different from a
Russian Soviet because it had no power.</p>


<p class="section">THE CROATS' BLUNDER</p>

<p>A number of deplorable transactions ensued, and they
were not all committed by the Italianists. The proclamations
which were sent from Zagreb, exhorting the people
to be tranquil, were printed in the two languages, but
some Croat super-patriots at Rieka tried to make the
town mono-lingual. At the railway station and the post
office they removed the old Italian inscriptions and put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>up Croatian ones, they wrote to the mayor in Croat,
which, although Dr. Vio has a Croat father and visited a
Croat school and a Croat university, was tactless; they
wrote that Croat would now be the language of the town,
which was a foolish thing to do. They even seem to have
demanded the evacuation of the town hall within twenty-four
hours. And the irresponsible persons who made
this demand were very properly snubbed by the municipal
authorities.</p>


<p class="section">MELODRAMA</p>

<p>These excited patriots, delirious with joy that at
last their own town was in their hands, did not set Rieka
on fire, nor did they murder women and children; but the
Italianists forthwith sent wireless messages to Venice,
screaming that all these enormities were taking place.
A few of them rushed off in motors to Triest, where they
made themselves into a Committee of Public Safety,
picked up some Triest sympathizers and flew on to Venice,
where they related breathless stories of foul deeds. One,
which appeared in the Italian Press, was that three
children of Rieka had been publicly committed to the
flames.</p>


<p class="section">FARCE</p>

<p>On November 4 an Italian destroyer, the <i>Stocco</i>,
shortly followed by the <i>Emanuele Filiberto</i>, a cruiser,
came on their errand of humanity. The I.N.C. at once
organized a plebiscite&mdash;by which is meant not a dull
giving and counting of votes in the usual election booths.
A plebiscite, at all events a plebiscite at Rieka, signifies
for the Italianists a mob assembled in a public thoroughfare;
photographs of such assemblies illustrate their
pamphlets and are entitled "plebiscito." At the harbour
the Italian Admiral, whose name was Raineri, told the
joyous I.N.C.&mdash;who now had flung aside their anonymity&mdash;that
he had come to bring them a salute from Italy,
and that he had been sent to shield Italians and to protect
Italian interests. The plebiscite threw up its hats and
waved its flags, and shouted its applause and sang its
songs. Flowers fell upon the Admiral, and on his men and
on the guns; the ships, as we are told, were changed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
floating gardens. But the sailors did not disembark.
Some ladies, members of the plebiscite, besought the
Admiral to come ashore, and hoping to persuade the
men, they climbed on board and playfully seized many
sailors' caps, which in the town, they said, could be redeemed.
Then shortly afterwards, the Yugoslav officials
came to greet the Admiral, as did the commandant of
the Yugoslav troops which had been for several days
guarding the town. Meanwhile some unknown persons
had been up in the old clock-tower and, for reasons known
perhaps to themselves, had taken in both the Croatian
and Italian flags; the Admiral drove up to see the
Governor, Dr. Lenac, and requested that his country's
flag should be rehoisted, which of course was done. And
until November 17 the Admiral was nearly every day
up at the Governor's palace, as a multitude of details had
to be discussed. A French warship arrived on the 10th,
followed by a British vessel on the 12th or 13th. Perfect
calm prevailed. Croatian and Italian flags flew everywhere,
as well as French ones, British and American.
The name of the Hotel Deak was altered to Hotel Wilson....
But the men of the <i>Emanuele Filiberto</i> and the
<i>Stocco</i> did not land. Colonel Tesli&#263; assured the Admiral
that if anyone started to set fire to an Italianist child or
to indulge in any other crime he would prevent it.</p>


<p class="section">PAROLE D'HONNEUR</p>

<p>All this was very disconcerting to the I.N.C. They
knew that on the hills outside Rieka were large numbers of
Italian troops, which had come overland from Istria. But
how to get them in? Rieka had not been ascribed to the
Italians by the London Treaty.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> ... On November 15
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>a detachment of Serbian troops arrived, under Colonel
Maximovi&#263;, and were given a magnificent reception.
Thousands of people accompanied them, and in front of
the French destroyer there was a manifestation. Some
of the Serbs, old warriors who had been under arms since
the first Balkan War, were moved to tears. The Italianists
were furious; Admiral Raineri called on the Governor
for an explanation of the Serbs' arrival. A conference
was held between the Admiral, the Colonel and two
Yugoslav officers. If the Serbs remained at Rieka, said
the Admiral, he would land his marines. Maximovi&#263;
said he had come in obedience to his orders, and that he
would have to prevent by force the disembarkation of the
Italians. At this moment a Serbian officer entered to
announce that Italian armoured cars were approaching
from Abbazia. Maximovi&#263; immediately ordered his
troops to mobilize, but the Admiral said a mistake had
been made and that the cars would be sent back. (The
Government Secretary, Dr. Ru&#382;i&#263;, had been told at
three o'clock by a telephone operator that the Admiral
had himself telephoned to Abbazia for the cars.) It was
decided at this conference that on Sunday, November 17,
the Yugoslav troops would evacuate the town, that it
would be occupied by Serbian and American troops, and
that, to mark the alliance, a small Italian detachment
would be landed. As Admiral Cagni, of Pola, ordered
that Italian troops should be disembarked at Rieka,
another conference was held between Admiral Raineri,
Colonel Maximovi&#263;, Colonel Tesli&#263; and Captain Dvorski
(of the Yugoslav navy), as well as French and British
officers. It was arranged <i>sous parole d'honneur d'officier</i>
that at 4 p.m. the Serbian troops should leave Rieka
and go to Porto R&eacute;, an hour's sea journey, that the
Yugoslav troops should remain, and that the Italians
should not land. No other steps would be taken till
November 20 at noon, and the Supreme Command would
be asked to settle the difficulty. As soon as the Serbian
troops were out at sea, the Italian army, under General di
San Marzano (attended by a kinematograph), marched
in from the hills, entering the town simultaneously from
four directions, in accordance with a strategic plan. The
General was told what Raineri had agreed to do; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
replied that he was Raineri's senior, that the final decision
rested with him, and that he intended to proceed into
the town. (One of the British officers is said to have
addressed him rather bluntly.) At 4.30 Raineri landed
his marines, and afterwards he was dismissed from his
post&mdash;not, indeed, for having broken his word given at
the inter-Allied conference, but for having delayed so
long before disembarking troops in the town. He said
he had received a written order from the Entente; if
only Maximovi&#263; had not left he might have shown it
him. With twenty carabinieri the General went to the
Governor's palace and asked Dr. Lenac to vacate it.
He was so excited that he almost pushed the doctor out.
"There is no room for the two of us," he said. And that
is how the Italian occupation began. The French and
British brought some troops in at a later date, but when
they had six hundred each the Italians had 22,000. With
the Italians came fifty Americans, so that the force might
have an international appearance. These Americans
were given broad-sheets, printed by the town Italianists
in English; they welcomed the Americans as liberators,
and informed them that the population had by plebiscite
declared for annexation to the Motherland. On the
same night the Yugoslav troops were turned out of their
barracks into the street by the Italian army.... These
are, I believe, the main facts as to the occupation which
has been the subject of much heated argument. I had
the facts from eye-witnesses and documents: I exposed
the evidence of each side to the criticism of the other.</p>

<p>Very soon the disorders began. On the evening of
the occupation Italian troops ran through the town,
accompanied by some of the plebiscite, and compelled
the people to remove the Yugoslav colours from their
button-holes. In cases they surrounded their victim
and used force. When this was used against women,
after the arrival of the French and British, it produced
some serious international affrays. The Italians, who
invariably outnumbered the others, did not scruple to
employ their knives; thus in the middle of December
two French soldiers were stabbed in the back and their
murderers were never found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE POPULATION OF THE TOWN</p>

<p>But there had been at Rieka an Englishman for whom
I have an almost inexpressible admiration. This was
Mr. A. Beaumont who, a couple of days after the Italians
occupied the town in the above-mentioned curious fashion,
sent from Triest a long message to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.
How can anyone not marvel at a gentleman who travels
to a foreign town which is in the throes of unrest and
who, undeterred by his infirmity, sits down to grasp
the rather complicated features of the situation? I am
not acquainted with Mr. Beaumont, but he must be
blind, poor fellow, for he says that the Yugoslavs occupied
with ill-concealed glee a town entirely inhabited by
some 45,000 Italians. Perhaps somebody will read to
him the following statistics made after the year 1868,
when Rieka came under Magyar dominion. The statistics
were made by the Magyars and Italianists combined, so
that they do not err in favour of the Yugoslavs. He
might also be told that the Magyar-Italian alliance closed
the existing Yugoslav national schools for the 13,478
Yugoslavs in 1890, while they opened Italo-Magyar
schools for the 13,012 "Italians" and Magyars. They
would not even allow the Yugoslavs to have at Rieka
an elementary school at their own expense. Everything
possible was done during these decades to inculcate hatred
and contempt for whatsoever was Slav, hoping thus to
denationalize the citizens. In view of all this it speaks
well for Yugoslav steadfastness that they were able to
maintain themselves. Here are the figures:</p>

<p>Assuming for the moment that these figures are correct&mdash;and
it is an enormous assumption<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;are not the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Autonomists to be found chiefly among the Italians and
Magyars? It is claimed that the Autonomist, Socialist
and Slav vote exceeds that of those who desire annexation
to Italy. One need not treat <i>au s&eacute;rieux</i> the great procession
organized by the Italianists, when they could not
scrape together more than about 4000 persons, including
many schoolboys and girls, the municipal clerks, visitors
from Italy, Triest and Zadar. One need not gibe the
Italianists with the numbers who followed Dr. Vio on
that famous day when, weary of palavering, he summoned
round him his supporters and strode off to the Governor's
palace, where General Grazioli, who had succeeded General
di San Marzano, was installed.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Arrived there, Dr. Vio
with a superb gesture begged the General to accept the
town in the name of Italy. It is not often in the lifetime
of a man that he has the opportunity of giving a whole
town away. Dr. Vio made the most of that occasion;
if the crowd which followed him was disappointing, there
may be good explanations. The allegiance of a town,
one may submit, should be settled in another fashion.
The house-to-house inquiry, conducted in the spring of
1919 by the Autonomists&mdash;resulting in an anti-annexionist
majority&mdash;was much impeded by the police; and it is
of course the business of the authorities and not of
any one party to hold elections in a town. Had the
Italian National Council, bereaving themselves of Italian
bayonets, <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'hold'">held</ins> a real plebiscite&mdash;secret or otherwise&mdash;the
result would doubtless have given them pain, but no
surprise.... And this will happen even if the Magyar
system of separating Rieka from the suburb of Su&#353;ak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>is perpetrated. Su&#353;ak contains about 12,500 Yugoslavs
and extremely few Italianists; and, by the way, to show
how the Magyars and the Italianists worked together,
it is worth mentioning that the Magyar railway officials
who lived at Su&#353;ak were allowed a vote at Rieka, while
if a Croat lived at Su&#353;ak and carried on his avocation
at Rieka he could vote in Su&#353;ak only. One must not
imagine that Su&#353;ak is a poor relation; most people
would prefer to live there. Dr. Vio was intensely wrathful
because the British General resided in a beautifully
situated house there by the sea. Not only is Su&#353;ak
about twenty yards, across a stream, from Rieka, but
from a commercial point of view their separation seems
absurd, since half the port, including the great wood
depots, is in Su&#353;ak. One of these timber merchants
presented an example of Italianization. His original
name was E.&nbsp;R. Sarinich and this was painted on his
business premises at Su&#353;ak, while in Rieka he called
himself Sarini. It must have caused him many sleepless
nights.... Counting Su&#353;ak with Rieka as one town, the
total population in the autumn of 1918 was about 51 per
cent. Yugoslav, 39 per cent. Italian and 10 per cent.
Magyar. These Magyars, by the way, seem not to have
been noticed by Mr. Beaumont. There were still a good
number of them in the town. "Whilst Italy might have
consented," says Mr. Beaumont, "to a compromise with
Hungary, had that State continued to exist as part of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, she certainly never contemplated
handing over"&mdash;["handing over" is rather
humorous]&mdash;"Fiume and its exclusively Italian population
to the Jugo-Slavs." Underneath Mr. Beaumont's dispatch
there is printed a semi-official statement, sent by Reuter,
from Rome. "Yesterday afternoon," it says, "our
troops occupied Fiume. The occupation, which was
made for reasons of public order, was decided upon in
view not only of the urgent and legitimate demands of the
Italian citizens of Fiume, but also of the insistent appeals
of eminent foreigners...."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE TALE CONTINUES ON THE NORTHERN ISLES</p>

<p>"Italy's reward," says Mr. Beaumont, "must be commensurate
with her sacrifices, and this is the attitude
assumed here. It is quite apart from the mere question
as to whether the Jugo-Slavs are in a majority in certain
districts or not. Those districts form a part of old Italian
territory, of Italian lands once peopled and occupied
by the Italian race and into which, with Austria's encouragement,
Slav populations have filtered." [I should
love to know what are Mr. Beaumont's sources.] "The
question must not be left to local ambition and antipathies.
It must be decided authoritatively and quickly
in strong counsel to the Jugo-Slav leaders." ... Let us
leave Rieka and see how the Italians decided authoritatively
and quickly on the island of Cres (Cherso). It is
a large but not thickly populated island; having 8162
inhabitants for 336 square kilometres. The Yugoslavs,
according to the census of 1910, number 5714 or 71&middot;3
per cent., while the Italian-speaking population amounts
to 2296 or 28 per cent. About the middle of November
the Italian authorities placed in the village of Martin&#353;&#263;ica,
which is in the south-western part of the island, 17 soldiers,
3 carabinieri and a lieutenant. Let me say at once
that I have never been to Cres, all my knowledge of this
case comes from a Franciscan monk who lives there,
the Rev. Ambrose Vlahov, Professor of Theology. At
Martin&#353;&#263;ica, he says, there is not a single Italianist;
the entire village is Yugoslav. When the Italian military
arrived the lieutenant insisted that the priest, Karlo
Hla&#263;a, should cease to sing the Mass in Old Slav, and that
for the whole service he should use Italian, the only
language, said the lieutenant, which he (the lieutenant)
understood. It was futile for the priest to demonstrate
what a ridiculous and unreasonable demand this was;
the lieutenant always came back to the subject, being
sometimes merely importunate and sometimes using
menaces. As Hla&#263;a was a model ecclesiastic, highly
esteemed by his parishioners, the lieutenant comprehended
that as long as this priest remained, he would
be foiled in his endeavours; he therefore sought an
opportunity to turn him out. On January 5, 1919, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
priest had, by order of his bishop, to read during the
service a pastoral letter on the duties of the faithful
towards the Church and towards their fellow-men; he
had also to add a simple and concise commentary. In
this letter there was a passage dealing with schools, and
the priest on that topic remarked that "by divine and
human law every nation may ask that its children should
be instructed in their mother tongue." When Mass
was finished, the mayor of the village assembled the
parishioners and notified them that henceforward, by
order of the lieutenant, there would no longer be in the
village a Croatian but an Italian school. And in order
to mollify the people he added that the lieutenant proposed
to give subsidies to such as stood in need; they
had only to present themselves before that officer. But,
though the people often found it hard to satisfy their simple
wants and were at that period in very great distress,
they walked away from this assembly without making
one step in the lieutenant's direction. This incited him
to such fury that he ran, accompanied by soldiers and
carabinieri, to the priest, and publicly, in a loud voice,
insulted him, calling him an intriguer, a rebel, an agitator.
On the following day the lieutenant had him conducted
to the village of Cres by two soldiers and a carabiniere,
who were all armed.... At Cres the priest was brought
before the commanding officer of the Quarnero Islands&mdash;our
old acquaintance, the naval captain of Krk&mdash;who
happened to be in this village. He started at once to
bellow at the priest and, striking the table with his
hand, exclaimed: "This is an Italian island, all Italian,
nothing but Italian and evermore it will remain Italian."
About a score of parishioners had come to Cres behind
their priest and his escort; they begged the commandant
to set him free. As an answer he harangued them with
respect to the Italian character of the islands, told them
that they would have to send their children to the Italian
school and that the whole village would be Italianized
and that <i>only in their homes</i> would they be permitted
to speak Croatian.... On January 8 the priest was
taken from Cres to the island of Krk, where he was informed
that he would have to leave his parish, but that
he might go back there for a day or two to fetch a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
necessities. It was raining in torrents when Father Hla&#263;a,
wet to the skin, arrived at his village on the 11th at seven
o'clock in the evening. As he suffers from several chronic
ailments&mdash;which was known to the lieutenant&mdash;this bad
weather had a grave effect upon him. When he reached
his house he went to bed at once with a very high temperature.
After about a quarter of an hour the lieutenant
appeared with two carabinieri and shouted at him that
he must get up. This draconian injunction had to be
obeyed, the more so as the lieutenant was labouring
under great excitement. He looked at the priest's
permit which allowed him to come back to the village,
and said, "If I were in your shoes I wouldn't venture
to come back here." These words gave Father Hla&#263;a an
impression that his life was in danger. The lieutenant
then ordered him not to go out among the people, but
to stop where he was until he was taken away. Five
days after this the priest was taken to Rieka, so that
the villagers were left with nobody to guard them against
the violence and the temptations offered them by the
Italians. The Croat inscription outside the school was
replaced by one in Italian and, with the lieutenant acting
as teacher, the doors were thrown open. But the only
children who went there were those of the lieutenant
himself and those of the mayor, who was a renegade in the
pay of the Italians. It was announced that heavy fines
would be inflicted if the other children did not come.
The villagers were in great trouble and in fear, with
nobody to give them advice or consolation.... There
may be some who will be curious to know concerning
the "Italian" population of this island, which, according
to the 1910 census, reached the large figure of 28 per cent.
At a place called Nere&#382;ine it was stated, in the census of
1880, that the commissioner had found 706 Italians and
340 Yugoslavs. Consequently an Italian primary school
was opened; but when it was discovered that the children
of Nere&#382;ine knew not one traitor word of that language,
the school was transformed into a Yugoslav establishment.
This is one case out of many; the 28 per cent.
would not bear much scrutiny.... But the Italian
Government, at any rate the "Liga Nazionale" to
whose endowment it contributes, had been taking in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
hand this question of elementary schools in Istria and
Dalmatia among the Slav population. The "Liga"
made gratuitous distribution of clothing, of boots, of
school-books and so forth. Some indigent Slavs allowed
themselves in this way to become denationalized.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">When, however, you examine the embroideries of these
islands&mdash;particularly beautiful on Rab and on the island
of wild olive trees, the neighbouring Pag&mdash;you will be
sure that such an ancient national spirit as they show
will not be easily seduced. The Magyars, by the way,
whose culture is more modern, borrowed certain features
that you find on these embroideries&mdash;the sun, for instance,
and the cock, which have from immemorial times been
thought appropriate by these people for the cloth a
woman wears upon her head when she is bringing a new
son into the world, whose dawn the cock announces.
Older than the workers in wood, much older than those
who carved in stone, are these island embroiderers. In
this work the people reproduced their tears and laughter.</p>


<p class="section">RAB IS COMPLETELY CAPTURED</p>

<p>What will it avail to put up "Liga" schools in these
islands, where the population is 99&middot;67 per cent. Yugoslav
and 0&middot;31 per cent. Italianist&mdash;that is, if we are content
to accept the Austrian statistics? What ultimate advantage
will accrue to Italy from the doings of her
emissaries, in November 1918, on the isle of Rab? It
was Tuesday, November 26, when the <i>Guglielmo Pepe</i>
of the Italian navy put in at the venerable town which
is the capital of that island. The commander, with an
Italianist deputy from Istria, climbed up to the town-hall
with the old marble balcony and informed the mayor and
the members of the local committee of the Yugoslav
National Council that he had come in the name of the
Entente and in virtue of the arrangements of the Armistice;
he said that in the afternoon Italian troops would
land, for the purpose of maintaining order. It was pointed
out to him that no disturbance had arisen, and that,
according to the terms of the Armistice, he had no right
to occupy this island. The commander announced that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he must disarm the national guard, but that the Yugoslav
flags would not be interfered with; the Italian flag
would only be hoisted on the harbour-master's office
and the military headquarters. On the next day, after
he had been unable to induce the town authorities to
lower their national flag from the clock-tower, he sent a
hundred men with a machine gun to carry out his wishes.
Filled with confidence by this heroic deed, he marched
into the mayor's office and dissolved the municipal
council. Armed forces occupied the town-hall, over which
an Italian flag was flown. An Italian officer was entrusted
with the mayoral functions and with the municipal
finances, while the post office was also captured and all
private telegrams forbidden, not only those which one
would have liked to dispatch, but those which came in
from elsewhere&mdash;they were not delivered. All meetings
and manifestations were made illegal. The commander,
whose name was Captain Denti di &mdash;&mdash; (the other part
being illegible), sent a memorandum to the municipal
council which explained that he dissolved it on account of
their having grievously troubled the public order; he did
this by virtue of the powers conferred upon him and in
the name of the Allied Powers and the United States of
America. The islanders did not pretend to be experts
in international law, but they did not believe that he
was in the right.</p>

<p>"I have every confidence," said the Serbian Regent,
when he was receiving a deputation of the Yugoslav
National Council a few days after this&mdash;"I have every
confidence that the operations for the freedom of the world
will be accomplished, that large numbers of our brethren
will be liberated from a foreign yoke. And I feel sure
that this point of view will be adopted by the Government
of the Kingdom of Italy, which was founded on these
very principles. They were cherished in the hearts and
executed in the deeds of great Italians in the nineteenth
century. We can say frankly that in choosing to have us
as their friends and good neighbours the Italian nation
will find more benefit and a greater security than in the
enforcement of the Treaty of London, which we never
signed nor recognized, and which was made at a time
when nobody foresaw the crumbling of Austria-Hungary."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">AVANTI SAVOIA!</p>

<p>It would be tedious to chronicle a thousandth part
of the outrages, crimes and stupidities committed on
Yugoslav territory by the Italians. Where they were
threatened with an armed resistance they yielded. Thus
on November 14, when they had reached Vrhnica (Ober-Laibach)
on their way to Ljubljana (Laibach), they were
met by Colonel Svibi&#263; with sixteen other officers who had
just come out of an internment camp in Austria. Svibi&#263;
requested the Italians to leave Vrhnica. He said that
he and the Serbian commander at Ljubljana would prevent
the advance of the Italians into Yugoslav territory.
They would be most reluctant to be obliged to resort to
armed force should the Italians continue their advance,
and they declined responsibility for any bloodshed which
might ensue.... The colonel of the Italian regiment
which had been stationed for some days at Vrhnica
informed the mayor of that commune that he had
received orders to depart; he retired to the line of demarcation
fixed by the Armistice conditions.</p>


<p class="section">THE ENTENTE AT RIEKA</p>

<p>It was ironical that a young State, struggling into
life, should be hindered, not by former enemies but
by friends of its friends. The Italians complained that
the French, British and Americans were not fraternizing
with them. In the first place, it was repugnant to the
sense of justice of these nations when they saw that
General di San Marzano, after having fraudulently seized
the town of Rieka and turning its absolutely legal Governor
into the street, did not ask the citizens to organize a
temporary local government, in which all parties would be
represented, but delivered, if you please, the town to fifteen
gentlemen, the I.N.C., who&mdash;at the very utmost&mdash;represented
half the population. On November 24, the local
newspaper <i>Il Popolo</i> announced in a non-official manner
that the I.N.C., in full accord with the military command,
had taken over the administration&mdash;<i>i poteri pubblici</i>.
This, by the way, was never confirmed by the representatives
of the other Allies. The I.N.C. furthermore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
declared null and of no effect any intervention of the
Yugoslav National Council in the affairs of the authorities
of the State of Rieka. When the Yugoslavs appealed
to the French, British or Americans they were naturally
met with sympathy and urged to have patience. Case
after case of high-handed dealing was reported to these
officers. They sometimes intervened with good effect;
far more injustice would have happened; far more
Croats and Autonomists, for instance, would have been
deported if the Allies had not interceded. It was now, of
course, impossible for Yugoslavs to wear their colours;
nor could they prevent the C.N.I. from hanging vast
Italian flags on Croat houses. One of the largest flags,
I should imagine, in the world swayed to and fro
between Rieka's chief hotel and the tall building on the
opposite side of the square&mdash;and both these houses,
mark you, were Croat property. But the Allied officers
knew very well (and the C.N.I. knew that they knew)
that more than thirty of the large buildings on the front
belonged to Croats, whereas under half a dozen were the
property of Italians or Italianists. The ineffable Mr.
Edoardo Susmel, in one of his pro-Italian books, entreats
certain French and British friends of the Yugoslavs to
come for one hour to Rieka and judge for themselves.
But twenty minutes would be ample for a man of average
intelligence. In many ways the presence of the Allies
grieved the C.N.I. The Allies looked without approval at
the "Giovani Fiumani," an association of young rowdies
of whose valuable services the C.N.I. availed itself. But
if these hired bands could not be dispersed they could have
limits placed upon their zeal. One of their ordinary
methods was to sit in groups in caf&eacute;s or in restaurants
or other places where an orchestra was playing, then to
shout for the Italian National Anthem and to make themselves
as nasty as they dared to anyone who did not rise.
If everybody rose, then they would wait a quarter of
an hour and have the music played again. The Allied
officers persuaded General Grazioli to prohibit any National
Anthem in a public place. It was distasteful to the Allied
officers when a local newspaper in French&mdash;<i>l'Echo de
l'Adriatique</i>&mdash;which had been established to present the
Yugoslav point of view, was continually being suppressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
For example, on December 14, it printed a short greeting
from the Croat National Council to President Wilson.
The most anti-Italian phrase in this that I could find
was: "Their fondest hope is to justify to the world,
to history and to you the great trust you have placed in
them." This was refused publication. It is unnecessary
to say that Yugoslav newspapers were confiscated and
their sale forbidden&mdash;after all, one didn't buy German or
Austrian newspapers in England during the War, and the
Italians now regarded the Croats as very pernicious
enemies. <i>La Rassegna Italiana</i> of December 15 called
its first article&mdash;printed throughout in italics&mdash;"I
Prussiani dell' Adriatico," and took to its bosom an "upright
American citizen" returning from a visit to "Fiume
nostra," who defined the Yugoslavs "on account of their
greed and their brutality and their spirit of intrigue and
their lack of candour as the Prussians of the Adriatic."
Personally I should submit that the Prussian spirit was
not wholly lacking in those two Italian officers who penetrated
on November 25 into the dining-room at the
quarters of the Custom-house officials and informed them
that they wanted their piano. No discussion was permitted;
the piano "transferred itself," as they say in
some languages, to the Italian officers' mess. The Prussian
spirit was not undeveloped in a certain Mr. &#352;tigli&#263;&mdash;his
name might cause his enemies to say he is a renegade,
but as my knowledge of him is confined to other matters,
we will say he is the noblest Roman of them all. He likewise
had a dig at the Custom-house officials; I know not
whether he was wiping off old scores. Appointed by the
I.N.C. as director of the Excise office, he communicated
with the resident officials&mdash;Franjo Jakov&#269;i&#263;, Ivan Mikuli&#269;i&#263;
and Grga Ma&#382;uran&mdash;on December 5, and told them
to clear out by the following Saturday, they and their
families, so that in the heart of winter forty-one persons
were suddenly left homeless.</p>


<p class="section">A CANDID FRENCHMAN</p>

<p>This and innumerable other manifestations of Prussianism
were brought to the attention of the French,
so that it was not surprising when a Frenchman made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
few remarks in the <i>Rije&#263;</i> of Zagreb. His article, entitled
"Mise au point," begins by a reference to the Yugoslav
cockades which were sometimes worn by the French
sailors. This, to the Italians, was as if an ally in the
reconquered towns of Metz and Strasbourg had sported
the colours of an enemy. "The cases are not parallel,"
says the Frenchman. "You have come to Rieka and
to Pola as conquerors of towns that were exhausted,
yielding to the simultaneous and gigantic pressure of the
Allied armies. These towns gave themselves up. Are
they on that account your property, and are we to consider
as a dead-letter the clauses of the Armistice which
settled that Pola should be occupied by the Allies? I
am not so dexterous a diplomat as to be able to follow
you along this track; let it be decided by others. But
we who were present perceived that your occupation,
which you had regulated in every detail, had a close
resemblance to the entry of a circus into some provincial
town, whose population is known beforehand to be of a
hostile character. It is needless to say that this masquerade,
these vibrating appeals to fraternity that were
placarded upon the walls gave us in that grey, abandoned
town an impression of complete fiasco." ["It is significant,"
writes Mr. Beaumont the Italophil, "that the
Slav population ... observe an attitude of strange
reserve and diffidence. They are silent and almost sullen.
When the Italian fleet first visited Pola there was hardly
a cheer...."] "Now let me tell you," says the Frenchman,
"that our entry into Alsace was different. Foch
was not obliged to send emissaries in advance in order to
decorate the houses with flags and to erect triumphal
arches. The French cockades had not nestled in the
dark hair of our Alsatian women since 1870, for forty-eight
years the tricolors had been waiting, piously folded
at the bottom of those wooden chests, waiting for us to
float them in the wind of victory&mdash;nous rentrions chez
nous tout simplement. Or, vous n'&ecirc;tes pas chez vous
ici, messieurs." ["Common reserve and decency should
have induced the Jugo-Slavs to abstain," says Mr. Beaumont,
"from rushing to take a place to which they were
not invited ... an exclusively Italian city."] "Whatever
you may assert," says the Frenchman, "everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
seems to contradict it. Your actors play their parts
with skill, but the public is frigid. Now the decorations
are tattered and the torches on the ramparts have grown
black.... Permit me, following your example, and
with courtesy, to call back the glories of old Italy, to
remind myself of the great figures that stride through
your history and that give to the world an unexampled
picture of the lofty works of man. Our sailors, who are
simple and often uncultured men, have no remembrance
of these things; the brutal facts, in this whirling age in
which we live, have more power to strike their imagination.
What is one to say to them when they see their comrades
stabbed, slaughtered by your men as if they were noxious
animals&mdash;yesterday at Venice, the day before that at Pola,
to-day at Rieka. Englishmen and Americans, your
Allies, receive your 'sincere and fraternal hand' which
holds a dagger. As a method of pacific penetration you
will avow that this is rather rudimentary and that the
laws of Romulus did not teach you such fraternity. We
have also seen you striking women in the street and
disembowelling a child. What are we to think of that,
<i>fratelli d'Italia</i>? Excuse us, but we are not accustomed
to such incidents. Is it not natural that the legendary,
gallant spirit of our sailors should infect the crowd?
Our bluejackets have looked in vain for the three colours
which are dear to them and which you have excluded
utterly from all your rows of flags. Well, in default of
them, they had no choice but to array themselves in the
cockades which dainty hands pinned on their uniforms....
And our 'poilus,' in their faded, mud-smeared garments
walk along 'your' streets, disdainfully regarded by your
dazzling and pomaded Staff. Do you remember that
these unshaven fellows who thrust back the Boche in 1918
are the descendants of those who in 1793 conquered
Italy and Europe with bare feet? Therefore do not
strike your breasts if now and then a smile involuntarily
appears upon their lips. O you who henceforth will be
known as the immortal heroes of the Piave, if our fellows
see to-day so many noble breasts, it was not seldom that
they saw another portion of your bodies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</p>

<p>"Yes, but that has nothing to do," some people will
say, "with Rieka's economical position. We admit that
Croatia has the historical right to the town, but we wish
to be satisfied that the Croats are not moved by reasons
that would cause Rieka's ruin. It may be nowadays,
owing to the unholy alliance between Magyars and
Italians, that the town, with respect to its trade, is more
in the Italian sphere than in that of Yugoslavia." The
answer to this is that Italy's share of the value of the
imports into Rieka in 1911 was 7&middot;5 per cent. of the total,
while her share of the value of the exports amounted to
13 per cent., which proves that Italy depends commercially
more on Rieka's hinterland than does that hinterland
upon Italy. It seems to be of less significance that the
millionaires of Rieka are mostly Croats, for they might
conceivably have enriched themselves by trade with Italy.
But of the nine banks, previous to the War the Italianists
were in exclusive possession of none, while the Croats
had four; of the eight shipping companies three were
Croat, three were Magyar, one British, one German&mdash;not
one Italian. It is true that some Italian writers lay
it down that Rieka's progress should be co-ordinated with
that of Venice, to say nothing of Triest, and should not
be exploited by other States to the injury of the Italian
Adriatic ports. Their point of view is not at all obscure.
And all disguise is thrown to the winds in a book which
has had a great success among the Italian imperialists:
<i>L'Adriatico et il Mediterraneo</i>, by Mario Alberti (Milan,
1915&mdash;third edition). The author says that Italy, having
annexed Triest and Rieka, will be "assured for ever";
her "economic penetration" of the Balkans "will no
longer be threatened" by the projected Galatz-Scutari
(Danube-Adriatic) railway; Italian agriculture which,
he says, is already in peril, "will be rescued"; the
Italian fisherman will no longer have the ports of Triest
and Rieka closed (for exportation to Germany and
Austria); the national wealth will be augmented by
"several milliards"; new fields will be open to Italian
industry; her economic (and military) domination over
the Adriatic will be absolute. There will, he continues,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be no more "disturbing" competition on the part of any
foreign mercantile marine; the Adriatic will be the sole
property of Italy, and so on. It would be worth while,
as a study of expressions, to photograph a few Rieka
Italianists in the act of reading these rapturous pages....
But lest it be imagined that I have searched for the most
feeble pro-Italian arguments in order to have no difficulty
in knocking them down, I will add that their strongest
argument, taken as it is from the official report of the
French Consul in 1909, appears to be that the commerce
of Croatia amounted then to only 7 per cent. of the total
trade of the port of Rieka. I am told by those who
ought to know that wood alone, which comes almost
exclusively from Croatia, Slavonia, etc., represents 16 per
cent. If other products, such as flour, wine, etc., are
considered, 50 per cent. of the total trade must be ascribed
to Croatia, Slavonia, etc. And that does not take into
account the western Banat and other Yugoslav territories.
Serbia, too, would now take her part, so that
there is no need to fear for the position of a Yugoslav
Rieka based solely&mdash;omitting Hungary and the Ukraine
altogether&mdash;on her Yugoslav hinterland. Rieka without
Yugoslavia would be ruined and would degenerate into a
fishing village, with a great past and a miserable future.
This could very well be seen during the spring of 1919
when the communications were interrupted between Rieka
and Yugoslavia. At Rieka during April eggs were
80 centimes apiece, while at Bakar, a few miles away,
they cost 25 centimes; milk at Rieka was 6 crowns the
litre and at Bakar one crown; beef was 30 crowns a
kilo and at Bakar 8 crowns. Italy was calling Rieka
her pearl&mdash;a pearl of great price; the Yugoslavs said
it was the lung of their country. It is within the knowledge
of the Italianists that the prosperity of Rieka would
not be advanced by making her the last of a chain of
Italian ports, but rather by making her the first port of
Yugoslavia. What has Italy to offer in comparison with
the Slovenes and the Croats? The maritime outlet
of the Save valley, as well as of the plains of Hungary
beyond it, is, as Sir Arthur Evans points out, the port of
Rieka. And, in view of the mountainous nature of the
country which lies for a great distance at the back of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Split and of Dubrovnik, it would seem that Rieka&mdash;and
especially when the railway line has been shortened&mdash;will
be the natural port of Belgrade.</p>


<p class="section">THE TURNCOAT MAYOR</p>

<p>One cannot expect in a place with Rieka's history
that such considerations as these will be debated, calmly
or otherwise, but at all events on their own merits. They
will be approached with more than ordinary passion,
since so many of the people of Rieka have been turncoats.
Any man who changes sides in his religion or
his nationality or politics&mdash;presuming, and I hope this
mostly was so at Rieka, that his reasons were not base&mdash;that
man will feel profoundly on these matters, more
profoundly than the average person of his new religion,
nationality or politics. He will observe the ritual, he
will give utterance to his thoughts with such an emphasis
that his old comrades will dislike him and his new associates
be made uneasy. Thus a convert may not always
be the most delightful creature in the garden, and he is
abundant at Rieka. As an illustration we may study
Dr. Vio. Many persons have repeated that he has a
Croat father, yet they should in fairness add that his
father's father came from Venice. But if he came from
Lapland, that ought to be no reason why the present
Dr. Vio should not, if he so desires, be an Italian. If
he had, when he arrived at what is usually called the
age of discretion, inscribed himself among the sons of
Italy&mdash;<i>&agrave; la bonheur</i>. But he took no such step. He
came out as a Croat of the Croats, for when he had finished
his legal studies he became a town official, but discovered
that his views&mdash;for he was known as an unbending
Croat&mdash;hindered his advancement. The party in possession
of the town council, the Autonomist party, would
have none of him. At last he, in disgust, threw up his
post and went into his father's office. He was entitled,
after ten years' service, to a pension; the Autonomists
refused to grant it for the reason that he was so dour a
Croat. Very often, talking with his friends, did Dr. Vio
mention this. He made a successful appeal to the Court
at Buda-Pest and a certain yearly sum was conceded to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him, which he may or may not be still obtaining. Then,
to the amazement of the Croats, he renounced his nationality
and became&mdash;no, not an Italian&mdash;a Magyar. He
was now one of those who called Hungary his "Madre
Patria," and as a weapon of the ruling Hungarian party
he was employed against the Italianists. In the year
1913 the deputy for Rieka died and Dr. Vio was a candidate,
his opponent being one of the Italianist party,
Professor Zanella. Dr. Vio had the support of the
Government officials, railway officials and so forth, and
was elected. Now he was a Magyar of the Magyars:
Hungarian police officials were introduced, and Magyar,
disregarding the town statutes, was employed by them
as sole official language. The citizens still speak of those
police.... The War broke out, and Dr. Vio donned a
uniform, serving chiefly on the railway line between Rieka
and Zagreb. Gradually he seems to have acquired the
feeling that it was unnatural for him to be a Magyar of
the Magyars, even though he was compelled, like so many
others, to wear this uniform. But one day in 1916 when
his friend and fellow-officer, Fran &#352;ojat, teacher at the
High School at Su&#353;ak, walked into his room at Meja,
when he happened to be putting little flags upon a map,
he prophesied&mdash;King Peter and the Tzar would have
been glad to hear him. Presently, he had himself elected
as the mayor, which enabled him to leave an army so
distasteful to him. How long would he wait until he
publicly became a Croat once again? He did not doubt
that the Entente would win, and told that same friend
&#352;ojat that Rieka on the next day would be Croat. To
another gentleman in June of 1918 he said he hoped
that he would be the first Yugoslav mayor of the town,
and on that day, out hunting, he sang endless Croat
songs. In September, to the mayor of Su&#353;ak, "You will
see," he said, "how well we two as mayors will work
together." When the Croat National Council entered
into office at the end of October he again met Mr. &#352;ojat,
just as he was going up to that interview in the Governor's
Palace. "Jesam li ja onda imao pravo, jesi li sada
zadovoljan?" he said. ("Was I not right that time?
Are you satisfied now?") Joyfully he pressed Mr.
&#352;ojat's hand and greeted the two other persons who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with him. And Mr. &#352;ojat was pleased to think that Vio
would now be a good Croat, as of old. But on the
following day he was an Italian.</p>


<p class="section">HIS FERVOUR</p>

<p>When I went up to see this variegated gentleman&mdash;whose
personal appearance is that of a bright yellow cat&mdash;he
purred awhile upon the sofa and then started striding
up and down the room. As he sketched the history of
the town, which, he said, had always been Italian and
would insist on being so, he spoke with horror of the days
when Jella&#269;i&#263; was in control, and then, remembering
another trouble, he raised both his hands above his head
and brought them down with such a crash upon the
desk where I was writing his remarks that&mdash;but nobody
burst in; the municipal officials were accustomed to his
conversation. He was reviling at that moment certain
Allied officers who had not seen fit to visit him. "I
care not!" he yelled. "We are Italian! I tell you
we are Italianissimi!" (He was glad enough, however,
when his brother Hamlet, who had remained a Yugoslav
and was on friendly terms with the chief of the carabinieri,
managed to obtain for the mayor a passport to Italy,
concerning which the carabinieri had said that they must
first of all apply to Rome.) The doctor was sure that
Yugoslavia would not live, for it had two religions;
and another notable defect of the Croats&mdash;"I speak their
language quite well," he said&mdash;was that in the whole of
Rieka not one ancient document was in Croatian. I
was going to mention that everywhere in Croatia until
1848 they were in Latin&mdash;but he saw what I was on the
point of saying and&mdash;"Look here! look here!" he cried,
"now look at this!" It was a type-written sheet in
English, whereon was recounted how the mayor had offered
to four Admirals, who came to Rieka on behalf of their
four nations, how he had, in order to meet them in every
way&mdash;"They asked me," he said, with blankness and
indignation and forgiveness all joined in his expression&mdash;it
was beautifully done&mdash;"they asked me, the Italian
mayor of this Italian town, whether it was truly an Italian
town!"&mdash;well, he had offered to take a real plebiscite,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on the basis of the last census, and the Admirals, while
appreciating his offer, had not availed themselves of it.
(Maybe some one had told them how the census officials,
chiefly members of the "Giovani Fiumani," had gone
round, asking the people whether they spoke Italian
and usually filling in the papers themselves. Presumably
the mayor did not propose to allow anyone who had then
been described as an Italian now to call himself Croat.)
I was just calculating what he was in 1910 when he played
a trump card and begged me to go up to the cemetery
and take note of the language used for the epitaphs. Then
let me return to him on the morrow and say what was the
nationality of Rieka. There seemed to be the question
if in such a town where Yugoslavs so often use Italian
as the business language, many of them possibly might
use it as the language of death; as it happened the first
Yugoslav to whom I spoke about this point&mdash;a lawyer
at whose flat I lunched the following day&mdash;produced a
little book entitled <i>Regolamento del Cimitero comunale
di Fiume</i>, and from it one could see that in the local
cemetery the blessed principle of self-determination was
in fetters. Chapter iii. lays down that all inscriptions
must have the approval of the civic body. You are
warned that they will not approve of sentences or words
which are indecent, and that they prohibit all expressions
and allusions that might give offence to anyone, to moral
corporations, to religions, or which are notoriously false.
No doubt, in practice, they waive the last stipulation,
so that the survivors may give praise to famous or to
infamous men; but I am told that they raised fewer
difficulties for Italian wordings, and that the stones which
many people used&mdash;those which the undertakers had in
stock, with spaces left for cutting in the details&mdash;were
invariably in Italian.... I hope I have not given an
unsympathetic portrait of the mayor who has about
him something lovable. Whatever Fate may have in
store for Rieka, Dr. Vio is so magnificent an emotional
actor that his future is assured. I trust it will be many
years before a stone, in Croat, Magyar or Italian, is
placed above the body of this volatile gentleman....
And then perhaps the deed of his administrative life
that will be known more universally than any other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
will be the omission of an <i>I</i> from certain postage stamps.
When the old Hungarian stamps were surcharged with
the word <span class="smcap">Fiume</span>, the sixty-third one in every sheet of
half an edition was defective and was stamped <span class="smcap">Fume</span>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<p class="section">THREE PLEASANT PLACES</p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of Rieka, across the
bay, lies Abbazia, which Nature and the Austrians have
made into a charming spot. By the famous "Strandweg"
that winds under rocks and palm and laurel, you go to
Volosca in the easterly and to Lovrana in the westerly
direction. Just at the back of all these pretty places
stands the range of Istria's green mountains. More than
twenty years ago a certain Dr. Krsti&#263;, from the neighbourhood
of Zadar, conceived the happy thought of
printing, in the peasant dialect, a newspaper which would
discourse on Italy in articles no peasant could resist.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>He was given subsidies, and for some time the newspaper
was published at Volosca. But perhaps the peasants
did not read it any more than those near Zadar would
take in the <i>Pravi Dalmatinac</i> ("The Real Dalmatian"),
which attempted a few years previous to the War to
preach sectionalism to the Serbo-Croats. The Italians
who came to the Abbazia district in November 1918
did not try such methods. In the combined commune
of Volosca-Abbazia the population at the 1910 census
consisted of 4309 Yugoslavs, 1534 German-Austrians,
and 418 Italians. Most of the 418 had never seen Italy;
the only true Italians were some officials who had come
from other parts of Istria. The official language was
Italian, which was regarded as more elegant. The
district doctor was Italian, but all the other 29 non-official
doctors were either Germans, Czechs or Croats.
At Volosca eighteen years ago there was no Croat school;
when one was opened the Italian school at once lost half
its membership and before the War had been reduced to
25 pupils. Before the War at Abbazia the Croat school
had six classes, while the Italian had ceased for lack of
patronage. The German school had 160 pupils; this
has now been dissolved, the pupils being mostly sent
to the re-opened Italian school. Thus it will be seen
that efforts were required to Italianize these places.
The efforts were continued even during the War, it is
said by the ex-Empress Zita. At any rate the people
who had altered their Italian names saw that they had
been premature and reassumed their former ones. They
reassumed the pre-war privileges: at Lovrana, for
example, they "ran" the village, not having allowed
any communal elections since 1905 and arranging that
their Croat colleagues in the council should all be illiterate
peasants. Some Italians were interned in 1915, as the
Croats had been in 1914, but the council came again
into their hands. At the meetings they had been obliged,
owing to the council's composition, to talk Croatian;
but their own predominance was undisturbed. On their
return to power during the War they displayed more
generosity, and admitted even educated Croats to the
council. And if such out-and-out Italians as the Signori
Grossmann, Pegan, etc. of Lovrana were kinder to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Yugoslavs than the Signori Grbac, Koro&#353;a&#263; and Codri&#263;
of Rieka it may be because the gentle spirit of the place
affected them. The leading families would even intermarry;
Signor Gelletich, Lovrana's Italian potentate,
gave his sister to the Croat chieftain. But, as we have
said, idylls had to end when in November 1918 the
Italian army came upon the scene. Abbazia and Volosca
and Lovrana were painted thoroughly in the Italian
colours. Public buildings, private houses&mdash;irrespective
of their inmates&mdash;had patches of green, white and red
bestowed upon them. Everything was painted&mdash;some
occupation had to be found for the military, who appeared
to be more numerous than the inhabitants. Meanwhile,
their commanding officers had other brilliant ideas: an
Italian kindergarten was opened at Volosca, and the
peasant women of the hills around were promised that
if they came with their children to the opening ceremony,
every one of them would be rewarded with 1 lb. of sugar.
So they came and were photographed&mdash;it looked extremely
well to have so many women seizing this first
opportunity of an Italian education for their babies.
Some one at Rieka most unfortunately had forgotten to
consign the sugar. The Italian officer who was appointed
to discharge the functions of podest&agrave;, that is,
mayor, of Abbazia was a certain Lieut.-Colonel Stadler.
He sent to Rome and Paris various telegrams as to
the people's ardent hope of being joined to Italy. The
people's own telegrams to Paris went by a more circuitous
route. But Stadler did not seem to care much
for the French, nor yet for the English. About a dozen
of the educated people, thinking that the French might
also come to Abbazia and wishing to be able to converse
with them, took lessons in that language; another dozen,
with a similar motive, had a Mr. Po&#353;ci&#263;, a naturalized
American subject, to give them English lessons. Away
with these baubles, cried Stadler; on January 10 he
stopped the lessons.</p>


<p class="section">ITALY IS LED ASTRAY BY SONNINO</p>

<p>While the Italians were thus engaged, what was the
state of opinion in their own country? Would Bissolati's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
organ, the <i>Secolo</i>, and the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>, which had
been favourable to the Slavs since Caporetto, have it
in their power to moderate the fury of the anti-Slav
papers? Malagodi of the <i>Tribuna</i> said on November 24
that the position at Rieka had been remedied. But was
the public fully alive to what was happening at Zadar
and &#352;ibenik? "While these cities have been nominally
occupied by us and are under the protection of our flag,
the Italian population has never been so terrorized by
Croat brutality as at this moment." The <i>Mattino</i> disclosed
to its readers in flaring headlines that "Yugoslav
oppression cuts the throats of the Italian population in
Dalmatia and terrorizes them." Would the people of
Italy rather listen to such thrills or to the <i>Secolo</i>,
which deprecated the contemptuous writings of Italian
journalists with regard to the Slavs&mdash;the <i>Gazzetta del
Popolo's</i> "little snakes" was one of the milder terms
of opprobrium. The <i>Secolo</i> recalled Italy's own illiterate
herds and the fact that the Italian Risorgimento
was judged, not by the indifferent and servile mass,
but by its heroes. It explained that the Treaty of
London was inspired by the belief that Austria would
survive, and that for strategic reasons only it had
given, not Rieka, but most of Dalmatia and the islands
to Italy.</p>

<p>It was calamitous for Italy that she was being governed
at this moment not by prudent statesmen such as she
more frequently produces in the north, but by southerners
of the Orlando and Sonnino type. The <i>Giornale d'Italia</i>
would at a word from the Foreign Minister have damped
the ardour of those journalists and other agitators who
were fanning such a dangerous fire. Sonnino once
himself told Radovi&#263;, the Montenegrin, that he could
not acquiesce in any union of the Yugoslavs, for such a
combination would be fraught with peril for Italians.
And now that Southern Slavs were forming what he
dreaded, their United States, it would have been sagacious&mdash;it
was not too late&mdash;if he had set himself to win their
friendship. Incidents of an untoward nature had occurred,
such as those connected with the Austrian fleet;
nine hundred Yugoslavs, after fighting side by side with
the Italians, had actually been interned, many of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wearing Italian medals for bravery;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the Yugoslavs, in
fact, by these and other monstrous methods had been
provoked. But it was not too late. A Foreign Minister
not blind to what was happening in foreign countries
would have seen that if he valued the goodwill of France
and England and America&mdash;and this goodwill was a
necessity for the Italians&mdash;it was incumbent on him to
modify his politics. The British Press was not unanimous&mdash;all
the prominent publicists did not, like a gentleman
a few months afterwards in the <i>Spectator</i>, say that "if
the Yugoslavs contemplated a possible war against the
Italians, by whose efforts and those of France and Great
Britain they had so recently been liberated, then would
the Southern Slavs be guilty of monstrous folly and
ingratitude." Baron Sonnino might have apprehended
that more knowledge of the Yugoslav-Italian situation
would produce among the Allies more hostility; he should
have known that average Frenchmen do not buy their
favourite newspaper for what it says on foreign politics,
and that the <i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i> and the <i>Humanit&eacute;</i> have
many followers who rarely read them. And, above all
else, he should have seen that the Americans, who had
not signed the Treaty of London, would decline to lend
themselves to the enforcement of an antiquated pact
which was so grievously incongruous with Justice, to
say nothing of the Fourteen Points of Mr. Wilson.
But Sonnino threw all these considerations to the winds.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>He should have reconciled himself to the fact that
his London Treaty, if for no other reason than that
it was a secret one, belonged to a different age and was
really dead; his refusal to bury it was making him
unpopular with the neighbours. One does not expect a
politician to be quite consistent, and Baron Sonnino is,
after all, not the same man who in 1881 declared that
to claim Triest as a right would be an exaggeration of
the principle of nationalities; but he should not in 1918
have been deaf to the words which he considered of such
weight when he wrote them in 1915 that he caused them
to be printed in a Green Book. "The monarchy of
Savoy," he said in a telegram to the Duke of Avarna on
February 15 of that year, "has its staunchest root in the
fact that it personifies the national ideals." Baron Sonnino
was rallying to the House of Karageorgevi&#263; most of those
among the Croats and Slovenes who, for some reason or
other, had been hesitating; for King Peter personified
the national ideals which the Baron was endeavouring
to throttle. As Mr. Wickham Steed pointed out in a
letter to the <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Corriera'"><i>Corriere</i></ins> <i>della Sera</i>, the complete accord
between Italians and Yugoslavs is not only possible and
necessary, but constitutes a European interest of the
first order; if it be not realized, the Adriatic would become
not Italian nor Slav, but German; if, on the other hand,
it were brought about, then the language and the culture,
the commerce and the political influence of Italy would
not merely be maintained but would spread along the
eastern Adriatic coast and in the Balkans in a manner
hitherto unhoped for; if no accord be reached, then the
Italians would see their whole influence vanish from every
place not occupied by overwhelming forces. But Sonnino,
a descendant of rancorous Levantines and obstinate
Scots, went recklessly ahead; it made you think that
he was one of those unhappy people whom the gods
have settled to destroy. He neglected the most elementary
precautions; he ought to have requested, for
example, that the French and British and Americans
would everywhere be represented where Yugoslav territory
was occupied. But, alas, he did not show that he
disagreed with the <i>Tribuna's</i> lack of wisdom when it
said that "the Italian people could never tolerate that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
beside our flag should fly other flags, even if friendly,
for this would imply a confession of weakness and
incapacity."</p>


<p class="section">THE STATE OF THE CHAMBER</p>

<p>The Government was in no very strong position, for
the Chamber was now moribund and the many groups
which had been formed, in the effort to create a war
Chamber out of one that was elected in the days of peace,
were now dissolving. An incident towards the end of
November exhibited not only the contrivances by which
these groups hoped to preserve themselves, but the eagerness
with which the Government rushed to placate the
powerful. A young deputy called Centurione, a member
of the National Defence group (the Fascio), made a furious
attack on Giolitti, under cover of a personal explanation.
He had been accused of being a police spy. Well, after
Caporetto, convinced that the defeat was partly due to
the work of Socialists and Giolittians, he had disguised
himself as a workman and taken part in Socialist meetings.
He was proud to have played the spy for the good of his
country, and he finished by accusing Giolitti and six others
of treason. The whole Chamber&mdash;his own party not being
strongly represented&mdash;seems to have made for Centurione
who, amidst an indescribable uproar, continued to shout
"Traitor!" to anyone who approached him. Sciorati,
one of the accused, was at last able to make himself heard.
He related how, at Turin, Centurione had made a fool of
himself. (But if Lewis Carroll had been with us still
he might have made himself immortal.) "I have seen
him disguised," said Sciorati, "as an out-porter at the
door of my own house." Giolitti appeared and demanded
an immediate inquiry, with what was described as cold
and menacing emphasis. And Orlando, the Prime Minister,
flew up to the Chamber and parleyed with Giolitti
in the most cordial fashion. Centurione's documents
were at once investigated and no proofs of treason were
found, no witnesses proposed by him being examined.
He was expelled from the National Defence group for
"indiscipline," his colleagues frustrating his attempts
to sit next to them by repeatedly changing their seats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
The attitude of the Fascio was humble and apologetic,
and the other significant feature of the incident was the
haste with which Orlando reacted to Giolitti's demand for
an inquiry.</p>


<p class="section">THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY</p>

<p>Baron Sonnino had to take into account not only the
unsteadiness of the ground on which the Government
stood, owing to these parliamentary regroupings, but the
general effects that would ensue from the country's
financial position. When, in spite of the victory and the
approach of peace, the exchange price of the lira dropped
2 to 3 points towards the end of November, this may have
had, contrary to what was thought by many, no connection
with a revolutionary movement. The fact that in
Triest the authorities had been obliged to isolate Italian
ex-prisoners on their return from Russia, since they were
imbued with revolutionary principles, at any rate were
uttering loud revolutionary cries, may have been the
mere temporary infection caught from their environment.
But that of which there was no doubt was the entire
truth of Caroti's statement when that deputy declared
at Milan that while Italy had been triumphant in the
military sphere, she had been economically overthrown.
Bankruptcy had not been announced, though it existed.
Sonnino may therefore have been impelled not only by
imperialism, by his inability to adjust himself to the new
international situation, but by the hope that through his
policy the new internal situation might be tided over.
If the thoughts of his fellow-countrymen could be directed
elsewhere than to bankruptcy and possible revolution, it
might be that in the meantime adroit measures and good
luck would brush away these disagreeable phenomena.
And he would then be rightly looked upon as one who had
deserved well of his country. So he set about the task
with such a thoroughness that he turned not alone the
thoughts of men, but their heads. Professor Italo Giglioli
addressed a letter to <i>The New Europe</i> in which he said
that he was claiming now not the territories given by the
Treaty of London, but considerably more. He wanted
all Dalmatia, down to Kotor. In foreign hands, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
said, Dalmatia would be an eternal danger, and besides:
"What in Dalmatia is not Italian is barbaric!" It was
a melancholy spectacle to see a man of Giglioli's reputation
saying that Dubrovnik, the refuge of Slav culture in
the age of darkness and the place in which Slav literature
so gloriously arose, was, forsooth, throughout its history
always Italian in culture and in literature. "Among
thinking people in Italy," proclaims the Professor, "there
are indeed but few who will abandon to the Balkan
processes a region and a people which have always been
possessed by Italian culture and which constitute the
necessary wall of Italy and Western Europe against the
inroads of the half-barbaric East." He protests that it
is ridiculous of <i>The New Europe</i> to assert that the secret
Treaty of London is supported by a tiny, discredited band
of Italians; and indeed that Review has regretfully to
acknowledge that many of his countrymen have been
swept off their feet and carried onward in the gale of
popular enthusiasm. Giglioli ends by asking that his
name be removed from the list of <i>The New Europe's</i>
collaborators. In vain does the <i>The New Europe</i> say that
the Professor's programme must involve a war between
Italians and Yugoslavs. "We must be prepared for a
new war," said the <i>Secolo</i> on January 12. "The Italians
who absolutely demand the conquest of Dalmatia must
have the courage to demand that the demobilization of
our Army should be suspended, and to say so very clearly."
And the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> warned Orlando of the consequences
if he took no steps to silence the mad voices.
"No one knows better," it wrote, "than the Minister of
the Interior, who is also Premier, that on the other coast
Italy claims that part of Dalmatia which was assigned
to her by the Treaty of London, but not more.... If
the Government definitely claims and demands the whole
of Dalmatia, then the agitation is justified; but if the
Government does not demand it, then we repeat that to
favour and not to curb the movement is the worst kind
of Defeatism, for it creates among Italians a state of
mind tending to transform the sense of a great victory
into the sense of a great defeat ... quite apart from
the intransigeance which this provokes in the Yugoslav
camp." It was in vain. And when Bissolati, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
resigned from office on the issue of Italo-Yugoslav relations,
attempted to explain his attitude at the Scala in
Milan on January 11, his meeting was wrecked, for
though the body of the hall and the galleries were relatively
quiet, if not very sympathetic&mdash;it was a ticket
meeting&mdash;the large number of subscription boxes, which
could not be closed to their ordinary tenants, had been
packed by Bissolati's adversaries, who succeeded in preventing
him from speaking. After a long delay he
managed to read the opening passage, but when he
came to the first "renunciation"&mdash;the Brenner for the
Teutons&mdash;disturbance set in finally and he left the
theatre. Afterwards the rioters adjourned to the <i>Corriere</i>
and <i>Secolo</i> offices, where they broke the windows. And
thus the first full statement of the war aims of any Italian
statesman could not be uttered. It was spread abroad
by the Press. Bissolati claimed to speak in the name of
a multitude which had hitherto been silent.... The
masses, he said, demanded, that their rulers should devote
all their strength to "the divine blessing of freeing mankind
from the slavery of war." ... "To those," he said,
"who speak of the Society of Nations as an 'ideology'
or 'Utopia' which has no hold over our people, we would
reply: Have you been in the trenches among the soldiers
waiting for the attack?" [Signor Bissolati had the
unique record, among Allied or enemy statesmen, of
having volunteered for active service, though past the
fighting age, and of having served in the trenches for
many months before entering the Orlando Cabinet.]</p>


<p class="section">A FOUNTAIN IN THE SAND</p>

<p>The speech was an admirable expression of that new
spirit which the Allies had been fighting for. "Each of
the anti-German nations," he said, "must guard itself
against any unconsciously German element in its soul,
if only in order to have the right to combat any trace
in others of the imperialism which had poisoned the outlook
of the German people." With regard to the Adriatic:
"Yugoslavia exists, and no one can undo this. But to
the credit of Italy be it said, the attainment of unity and
independence for the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
must be alike the reason and the certain issue of our
War.... Italy felt that if Serbia had been swallowed
up by that monstrous Empire&mdash;itself a vassal of the
German Empire&mdash;her own economic expansion and
political independence would have received a mortal
blow. And so she was on Serbia's side, first in neutrality,
then in intervention.... Those who only see, in the
formation of the Yugoslav State, a sympathetic or antipathetic
episode of the War, or a subsidiary effect of it,
have failed to detect its inner meaning." As for the
Treaty of London which was concluded against the enemy,
it was not to be regarded as intangible against a friendly
people. By special grants of autonomy, as at Zadar, or
by arrangements between the two States, he would see
the language and culture of all the trans-Adriatic sons of
Italy assured. He warned his countrymen lest, in order
to meet the peril of a German-Slav alliance against them,
they should have to subordinate themselves to France
and England, and be their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s instead of their real
Allies&mdash;a situation not unlike that of the Triple Alliance
when Germany protected them against the ever-imminent
attack of Austria.... "But perhaps the Yugoslavs
will not be grateful or show an equal spirit of conciliation?
Certainly they will then have no vital interests
to push against Italy, and in the long run sentiments
follow interests." There was, in fact, throughout the
speech only one questionable passage, that in which he
said that "if Italy renounced the annexation of Dalmatia
she might obtain from Yugoslavia or from the Peace
Conference the joy of pressing to her heart the most Italian
city of Rieka, which the Treaty of London renounced."
This may have been a sop to Cerberus. But Bissolati's
appeals to justice and to wisdom fell upon the same stony
ground as his demonstration that Dalmatia's strategic
value is very slight from a defensive point of view to
those who possess Pola, Valona and the outer islands.
There is a school of reasonable Italians, such as Giuseppe
Prezzolini, who for strategic reasons asked for the isle of
Vis. Mazzini himself, after 1866, found it necessary,
for the same reasons, that Vis should be Italian, since it
is the key of the Adriatic. Some of us thought that it
might have been feasible to follow the precedent of Port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Mahon, which Great Britain occupied without exercising
sovereignty over the rest of the island of Minorca. The
magnificent harbour of Vis, perfectly protected against
the bora, would have satisfied all the demands of the
Italian navy. Vis is to-day practically as much Slav
as Minorca was Spanish, and if the Slavs had been left in
possession of the remainder of that island it would have
proved the reverse of a danger to the Italians, since with
a moderate amount of good sense the same relations would
have existed as was the case upon Minorca.... The
solution which was ultimately found in the Treaty of
Rapallo was to allocate to the Italians in complete sovereignty
not the island of Vis, but the smaller neighbouring
island of Lastovo.</p>

<p>While the vast majority of Italians would not listen
to Bissolati they delighted in Gabriele d'Annunzio. The
great poet Carducci<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> had his heart full when he thought
about the ragged, starving Croat soldiers, pitiable victims
of the Habsburgs, exploited by them all their lives and
fighting for them in a foreign land&mdash;and they fought
bravely; but as they were often clad in miserable garments,
they were called by those who wanted to revile
them "Croat dirt." And that is what they are to
Gabriele d'Annunzio. When the controversies of to-day
have long been buried and when d'Annunzio's works are
read, his lovers will be stabbed by his <i>Lettera ai Dalmati</i>.
And if the mob had to be told precisely what the Allies
are, it did not need a lord of language to dilate upon
"the thirty-two teeth of Wilson's undecipherable smile,"
to say that the French "drunk with victory, again fly
all their plumes in the wind, tune up all their fanfares,
quicken their pace in order to pass the most resolute
and speedy&mdash;and we step aside to let them pass." No
laurel will be added to his fame for having spoken of
"the people of the five meals" [the English] which, "its
bloody work hardly ended, reopens its jaws to devour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>as much as it can." All Italy resounded with the catchword
that the Croats had been Austria's most faithful
servants, although some Italians, such as Admiral Millo,
as we shall see, when writing confidentially, did not say
anything so foolish. Very frequently, however, as the
Croats noticed, those who had been the most uncompromising
wielders of Austria's despotism were taken
on by Italy, the new despot. For example, at Split
when the mayor and other Yugoslav leaders were arrested
at the beginning of the War, one Francis Mandirazza
was appointed as Government Commissary, after having
filled the political post of district captain (Bezirkshauptmann)
which was only given to those who were in the
entire confidence of the Government. As soon as the
Italians had possession of &#352;ibenik they took him into their
service.</p>


<p class="section">THOSE WHO HELD BACK FROM THE PACT OF ROME</p>

<p><i>The New Europe</i>, whose directors had taken a chief
part in bringing the Italians and the Yugoslavs together,
which congress had resulted in the Pact of Rome, of April
1918, pointed out that in those dark days of the high-water
mark of the great German offensive, this Pact&mdash;which
provided the framework of an agreement, on the
principle of "live and let live"&mdash;was publicly approved
of by the Italian Premier and his colleagues, but was
rejected now when the danger was past and Austria was
broken up. Those who brought about the Pact reminded
Italy that she was bound to it by honour and that the
South Slav statesmen never had withdrawn from the
position which it placed them in with reference to Italy....
Everyone must sympathize with the disappointment
of those gentlemen who&mdash;Messrs. Franklin-Bouillon,
Wickham Steed and Seton-Watson were associated
in this endeavour&mdash;had striven for a noble end, had
achieved something in spite of many obstacles, and now
saw that one party simply would not use the bridge which
they had built for it. This party had, however, shown
such reticence both while the bridge was being made
and afterwards that one could scarcely be astonished
at their attitude. The Congress at Rome was in no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sense official, but a voluntary meeting of private persons,
who were got together with a certain amount of trouble.
So unofficial, in fact, was the Congress that those Serbs
who worked with the representatives of the Yugoslav
Committee belonged to the Opposition; the Serbian
Government, then in Corfu, not giving their adhesion to
the Congress, which was perhaps a very clever move on
the part of Pa&#353;i&#263;. Whether it be true or not that Signor
Amendolla, the General Secretary&mdash;he is the political
director of the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>&mdash;was asked by the
Yugoslav Committee not to admit any Serbian deputies
except those of the Opposition, it appears that no other
Serbs took a part in the proceedings. The Italian Government
adopted an ambiguous attitude, for while Orlando
publicly endorsed the resolutions, as did several other
Ministers, notably Bissolati, the Premier gave no confirmation
to those who interpreted his attitude as implying
the tacit abandonment of Italy's extreme territorial
claims. Sonnino was so reserved that he took no share
at all in the Congress and refused to receive the Yugoslavs.
He made no secret of his determination to exact the
London Treaty. Nothing was signed by the Italian
Government; and if Orlando's honour was involved it
certainly does not seem possible to say the same of
Sonnino. It may be that Pa&#353;i&#263; foresaw what would
happen and was therefore unwilling to be implicated.
He is an astute statesman of the old school&mdash;"too old,"
says <i>The New Europe</i>, which regards him as an Oriental
sultan. But respecting the Pact of Rome they were
rather at issue with the Italians. What the Italians
gained was that the various clauses of the Pact were used
as the basis for propaganda in the Austrian ranks on the
Piave. And when once the Austrian peril had vanished
the old rancour reappeared, particularly when, by the
terms of the military armistice with Austria, Italy obtained
the right to occupy a zone corresponding with
what she was given by the London Treaty. Whereas in
that instrument the frontiers were exactly indicated,
there was in the Pact of Rome no more than a general
agreement that the principles of nationality and self-determination
should be applied, with due regard to other
"vital interests." Bissolati's group was in favour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
something more definite, but to this Orlando was not well
disposed; and Trumbi&#263;, the President of the Yugoslav
Committee, did not avail himself of the, perhaps rather
useless, offer of some Serbs who were not participating
in the Congress, but suggested that while he worked with
the Government they would keep in touch with the
Bissolati group; even as Bismarck who would work
openly with a Government, and through his agents with
the Opposition.</p>


<p class="section">GATHERING WINDS</p>

<p>As the Serbian Society of Great Britain observed in
a letter of welcome which they addressed to Baron Sonnino
on the occasion of a visit to London, they were convinced
"after a close study and experience of the Southern
Slav question in all its aspects and some knowledge of
the Adriatic problem as a whole, that there is no necessary
or inevitable conflict between the aspiration of the
Southern Slav people towards complete unity and the
postulates of Italian national security and of the completion
of Italian unity; but that, on the contrary, there
exist strong grounds for Italo-Southern Slav co-operation
and friendship." The Italian Government, however,
had now got almost their whole country behind them,
and in the months after the War so many Italians had
become warlike that they were enchanted with the picture
drawn by Gabriele d'Annunzio: "And what peace will
in the end be imposed on us, poor little ones of Christ?
A Gallic peace? A British peace? A star-spangled
peace? Then, no! Enough! Victorious Italy&mdash;the
most victorious of all the nations&mdash;victorious over herself
and over the enemy&mdash;will have on the Alps and over her
sea the <i>Pax Romana</i>, the sole peace that is fitting. If
necessary we will meet the new plot in the fashion of the
Arditi [units of volunteers employed on specially dangerous
enterprises], a grenade in each hand and a knife between
our teeth." It is true that the other poor little ones of
Christ, the Franciscans, who are greatly beloved by the
people of Dalmatia, from whom they are sprung, have
hitherto preached a different <i>Pax Romana</i>. The Dalmatian
clergy, who are patriotic, have been rather a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
stumbling-block in the way of the Italians. A very small
percentage of them&mdash;about six in a thousand&mdash;have been
anti-national and opportunist. At one place a priest
whom his bishop had some years ago had occasion to
expel, returned with the Italian army in November 1918
and informed the bishop that he had a letter from the
Pope which reinstated him, but he refused to show this
letter. He was anxious to preach on the following Sunday;
the bishop declined to allow him. Then came unto the
bishop the chief of the Italian soldiery and he said unto
him: "Either thou shalt permit this man to preach
or I will cause thine office to be taken from thee." Unfortunately
the bishop yielded, and the sermon, as one
would imagine, was devoted to the greater glory of the
Italians. Sometimes the Italians, since their occupation,
have made a more humorous if not more successful use
of the Church. On Palm Sunday, after the service a
number of peasants, in their best clothes, were walking
through a village holding the usual palm leaves in their
hands. They were photographed, and a popular Italian
newspaper printed this as a full-page coloured illustration.
It was entitled: "Dalmatian Peasants on their
way to pay Homage to Admiral Millo."</p>

<p>This policy of a grenade in each hand and a knife
between the teeth makes a powerful appeal to the munition
firms. And others who feed the flame of Italo-Slav
hatred are, as Gaetano Salvemini, the anti-chauvinist,
pointed out in the <i>Unit&agrave;</i> of Florence, those professional
gladiators who would lose their job, those agents of the
Italo-German-Levantine capitalism of the Triest Chamber
of Commerce who want to be rid of the competition of
Rieka and think that this can only be obtained by annexation,
and also those Italian Nationalists who believe that
the only path to national greatness is by acquiring territory
everywhere. No light has come to them from the
East; the same arguments which are now put forward
by such societies as the "Pro Dalmatia" could be heard
in Italy before she possessed herself of Tripoli. One
heard the same talk of strategic necessities; one heard
that nearly all the population was waiting with open
arms for the Italians; one heard that from a business
point of view nothing could be better; one heard that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the Italians without Tripoli would be choked out of the
Mediterranean. And what have been the fruits of the
conquest of Tripoli? No economic advantages have
been procured, as Prezzolini wrote, no sociological, no
strategic, no diplomatic benefits. A great deal of money
was thrown away, a vast amount of energy was wasted,
and thousands of troops have to be stationed permanently
in the wilderness. That expedition to Tripoli, which was
one of the gravest errors of Italian politics, was preceded
by clouds of forged documents, of absurdities, of partial
extracts out of consular reports, of lying correspondence
which succeeded in misleading the Italians.</p>


<p class="section">WHY THE ITALIANS CLAIMED DALMATIA</p>

<p>"The Italian Government," said the <i>Morning Post</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
"is well qualified to judge of the interests of its own
people." Here the <i>Morning Post</i> is not speaking of the
Italian Government which dealt with Tripoli, but that
which has been dealing with Dalmatia. The reasons
which have been advanced for an Italian or a partly
Italian Dalmatia are geographical, botanical, historical,
ethnical, military, naval and economic. As for the
geographical reasons: even in the schools of Italy they
teach that the Italian natural frontier is determined by
the point of division of the waters of the Alps and that
this frontier falls at Porto R&eacute;, a few miles to the south of
Rieka&mdash;everything to the south of that belonging to the
Balkan Peninsula. We may note the gallant patriotism
of an Italian cartographer mentioned by Prezzolini;
this worthy has inscribed a map of Dalmatia down to the
Narenta with the pleasing words: "The new natural
boundaries of Italy." As for the argument that the
flora of Dalmatia resembles that of Italy, this can equally
well be employed by those who would annex Italy to
Dalmatia. Historically, we have seen that Venice,
which held for many years the seacoast and the islands,
did not alter the Slav character of the country. It is not
now the question as to whether Venice deserved or did
not deserve well of Dalmatia, but "the truth is," says
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>M. Emile Haumant,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the learned and impartial French
historian, "the truth is that when Marmont's Frenchmen
arrived they found the Slav language everywhere, the
Italian by its side on the islands and the coast, Italian
customs and culture in the towns, and also the lively
and sometimes affectionate remembrance of Venice;
but nowhere did a Dalmatian tell them that he was an
Italian. On the contrary, they all affirmed that they
were brothers of the Slav beyond, in whose misfortunes
they shared and whose successes they celebrated." The
Italians themselves, in achieving their unity, were very
right to set aside the undoubted historical claims of the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, those of the House of Este
and those of the Vatican, seeing that they were in opposition
to the principle of nationality and the right of a
people to determine its own political status. With regard
to the ethnical reasons, we are flogging another dead
horse, as the statistics&mdash;even those taken during the
Italian occupation&mdash;prove to the meanest intellect; and
now the pro-Italians, despairing to make anyone believe
that the 97&middot;5 per cent. of the people of Dalmatia are
truly Italians who by some kink in their nature persist
in calling themselves Slavs, have invented a brand new
nationality, the Dalmatian, after the classic style of the
late Professor Jagi&#263; who at Vienna, under the pressure of
the Austrian Government, began talking of the Bosnian
language in order not to say that it is Serbo-Croat. He
was drowned in laughter. With respect to the military
reasons, the Dalmatian littoral cannot be defended by a
State which is not in possession of the hinterland. In
time of peace a very strong army would be needed;
Italy would, in fact, have to double her army for the
defence of a frontier 700 kilometres long. And in the
event of war it would be necessary either to abandon
Dalmatia or to form two armies of operation, one on the
frontiers of Julian Venetia, the other in Dalmatia, and
without any liaison between them. From the military
point of view it is incomparably more to the interest of
Italy that she should live on friendly terms with the
people of the eastern shore of the Adriatic than that she
should maintain there an army out of all proportion to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>her military and economic resources&mdash;an army which in
time of war would be worse than useless, since, as M. Gauvain
observes, the submarines, which would find their
nesting-places in the islands, would destroy the lines of
communication. An Italian naval argument is, that if
she had to fight on the eastern side of the Adriatic her
sailors in the morning would have the sun in their eyes;
but the Yugoslavs would be similarly handicapped in the
case of an evening battle. With regard to the economic
reasons, the longitudinal lines will continue to guarantee
to the Germans and Magyars the commercial monopoly
of the East, and Italy will perceive that she has paid
very dearly for a blocked-up window. The sole method
by which Italy can from the Adriatic cause her commerce
to penetrate to the Balkans is by concluding with a
friendly Yugoslavia the requisite commercial treaties,
which will grow more valuable with the construction of
the lateral railways, running inland from the coast,
which Austrians and Magyars so constantly impeded.</p>


<p class="section">CONSEQUENCES OF THE TREATY OF LONDON</p>

<p>If, then, it is difficult to see where the Italian interests
will be profited by the possession of Dalmatia, there
remains the argument that, irrespective of the consequences,
she must have a good deal of it since it was
allotted to her by the Treaty of London,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> although
the engagements entered into by Italy, France and
Great Britain when they signed the Treaty with
Germany caused the earlier instrument to be subject to
revision where its terms had been disregarded. Signor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>Orlando, in an interview granted in April 1918 to the
<i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i>, eagerly insisted that the Treaty
had been concluded against the Austrian enemy, not
against the Yugoslav nation; and if this be more than
a mere phrase it is clear that with the disappearance of
Austria-Hungary the Treaty automatically fell to the
ground. By this Treaty of April 1915, France and Great
Britain are bound&mdash;if necessary, by force of arms&mdash;to
assist Italy in appropriating what, I believe, will be
acknowledged to be some one else's country, at all events
a country the vast proportion of whose inhabitants have
determined that on no account will they come under the
Italians. Would it not have been advisable if those
who signed this document had made a few not very
recondite researches into eastern Adriatic questions?
They must have felt some qualms at the cries of indignation
and amazement which arose when the provisions of
the Treaty were disclosed, for it did not remain a secret
very long. They had imagined, on the whole, that as
Dalmatia had been under alien rulers, Venetian, Austrian
and so forth, for so many years it really would not matter
to them very much if they were governed from Vienna or
from Rome. Perhaps a statesman here and there had
heard that the Dalmatian Diet had petitioned many times
since 1870 that they should be reunited to their brothers
of Croatia and Slavonia in the Triune Kingdom. But all
the calculations seem to have been made upon the basis
that Austria-Hungary would survive, as a fairly formidable
Power at any rate. The union of the Southern
Slavs was too remote, and the Italians would be kindly
masters. When the howl of indignation rose, the statesmen
seem to have conceived the hope that the Italians
would be generous and wise. The chief blame for the
Treaty does not rest, however, on the Frenchmen and the
Englishmen, but on the Russians; it was naturally felt
that they should be more cognizant of Slav affairs, and
if they were content to sign the Treaty, France and
England might well follow their example. When Dr.
Zari&#263;, the Bishop of Split, saw the former Russian Foreign
Minister, M. Sazonov, in Paris in the spring of 1919, this
gentleman was in a state of such dejection that the Bishop,
out of pity, did not try to probe the matter. "Sometimes,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
said Sazonov, "sometimes the circumstances are
too much opposed to you and you have to act against
your inclinations."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The French and British statesmen
gave the Bishop the impression that they were ashamed
of the Treaty. He read to them in turn a memorandum
in which he suggested that the whole Dalmatian question
should be left to the arbitration of President Wilson, who
was well informed, through experts, of the local conditions.
And was it, in any case, just that an Italian, both claimant
and judge, should sit on the Council of Four, to which no
Yugoslav was admitted? To President Wilson the
Bishop said, "You have come to fight for the just cause."</p>

<p>The President made no reply.</p>

<p>The Bishop, a native of the island of Hvar, a great
linguist, was a man who made you think that a very
distinguished mind had entered the body of the late
Cardinal Vaughan. To him the most noticeable features
of the President were the clear brow, the mystic eyes
and the mouth which showed that he stood firmly on the
ground.</p>

<p>"You have come to work and fight for the peace,"
said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, to fight," said Dr. Wilson. "And I
will act with all my energy. You," he said, "you must
help me."</p>

<p>"I will help you," said the Bishop, "with my prayers."</p>

<p>The Yugoslav Delegation in Paris had, on the authority
of the Belgrade Cabinet, suggested that the question
should be arbitrated.</p>

<p>"The Italians have declined the arbitration," said
Dr. Zari&#263;, "just as in the War Germany and Austria
declined yours."</p>

<p>The President nodded.</p>

<p>"They have committed many disorders in our fair
land," said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said the President.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>But, it will be asked, why did not Dr. Wilson insist
on a just settlement of the Adriatic question, taking into
his own hands that which Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau
were so chary of touching? These two statesmen,
with the London Treaty hanging over them, wanted
Wilson's assent for matters in which British and French
interests were more directly concerned, while they required
Sonnino's co-operation in the Treaty with Germany. It
would have suited them very well if Wilson had taken
such energetic steps with Italy that they themselves
could, suitably protesting to Sonnino, be swept along by
the presidential righteousness. But Dr. Wilson was
disappointing those who had&mdash;in the first place because
of the lofty language of his Notes&mdash;awaited a really great
man. He was seen to be out of his depth; strenuously
he sought to rescue his Fourteen Points and to steer the
Covenant of the League through the rocks and shallows
of European diplomacy. Sonnino, playing for time,
involved the good Wilson in a maze of confused negotiations,
while nearly every organ of Italian official and
unofficial opinion was defaming the President. On
April 15 Dr. Wilson in a memorandum suggested the
famous "Wilson Line" in Istria, which thrust the Italian
frontier westwards, so that Rieka should be safeguarded
from the threat of an Italian occupation of Monte Maggiore.
Italy was to give up northern Dalmatia and all the
islands, save Lussin and Vis; in return she was to be
protected by measures limiting the naval and military
powers of Yugoslavia. When Wilson appealed over the
head of the Italian Government to the people, their
passions had been excited to such a degree that much
more harm was done than good. It is said that he had
promised Messrs. Lloyd George and Clemenceau that he
would not publish his letter for three hours, but that&mdash;pride
of authorship triumphing over prudence&mdash;it was
circulated to the Press two hours before this time was
up, and a compromise which had been worked out by Mr.
Lloyd George had perforce to be abandoned. This was
one of the occasions when the President's impulsiveness
burst out through his cold exterior, when his strength of
purpose, his grim determination to fight for justice were
undermined by his egotism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">ITALIAN HOPES IN MONTENEGRO</p>

<p>For months the Italians had been consoling themselves
with the thought that such a hybrid affair as Yugoslavia
would never really come into existence. Some visionaries
might attempt to join the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes,
yet these must be as rare as Blake, who testified that
"when others see but the dawn coming over the hill, I
see the sons of God shouting for joy." One only had to
listen, one could hear already how they were growling,
how they were quarrelling, how they were killing each
other. In Montenegro, for example, and Albania the
Italians were greatly interested&mdash;not always as spectators.
If you tell a hungry Montenegrin peasant in the winter
that there is a chance of his obtaining flour and&mdash;well,
that he may have to fight for it, but he will get good
booty at Cetinje, he will go there. In January 1919
there was a battle. "The Montenegrin people rose in rebellion
against the Serbians to recover their independence,"
said an Italian writer, one Dr. Attilio Tamaro in a weekly
paper called <i>Modern Italy</i>, which was published in London.
"This intensely popular revolt, animated by the heroically
patriotic spirit of the Montenegrins, was relentlessly
suffocated in blood. In the little city of Cetinje alone,
where there are but a few thousand inhabitants, over
400 were killed and wounded. The Serbians and the
French together accomplished this sanguinary <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'repression,'">repression.</ins>
We repeat, it is painful to see the French lend their <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'men.'">men,</ins>
their blood and their glorious arms to the carrying out of
the low intrigues of Balkan politics." The money and
the arms that were found on the dead and captured
rebels were Italian. If the schemes of the Italians had
not been upset by the timely arrival of the Yugoslav
forces, with the few Frenchmen, they would have occupied
Cetinje and restored the traitor king. As it was, they
occupied Antivari, from which place they smuggled arms
and munitions into the country. They conspired with the
adherents of the old r&eacute;gime, a very small body of men
who were enormously alarmed at the loss of their privileged
position. The chief of them was Jovan Plamenac, a
former Minister whom the people at Podgorica had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
refused to hear, a few weeks previously, when he attempted
to address them. He was hated on account of the most
ruthless fashion in which, as Minister, he had executed
certain of his master's critics at Kola&#353;in. There was a
time, during the first Balkan War, when he advocated
union with Serbia and on April 6, 1916, he wrote in the
<i>Bosnische Post</i> of Sarajevo that Nikita, owing to his flight,
"may be regarded as no longer existing." But his unpopularity
remained and, with vengeance burning in his
heart, he went from Podgorica to the Italians. They
concocted a nice plan&mdash;he was to raise an army of his
countrymen and the Italians would bring their garrison
from Scutari. On January 1 Plamenac and his partisans
tried to seize Virpazar, on the Lake of Scutari&mdash;the Commandant
of the Italian troops at Scutari, one Molinaro,
had asked the chief of the Allied troops, three days before
this attempt, whether he might dispatch two companies
to that place for the purpose of suppressing the disorders
which had not yet come to pass. Another rising was
engineered at Cetinje, where twenty or thirty of the poor
peasants who had let themselves be talked over by Plamenac
were killed; the rest of the misguided fellows
were sent home, only their leaders being detained. Plamenac
himself escaped to Albania.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> On the side of the
Montenegrin Provisional Government no regular troops
were available, as the Yugoslav soldiers who had lately
arrived were engaged in policing other parts of the country.
Volunteers were needed and a body of young men, mostly
students, enrolled themselves. They were so busy that
they omitted to inform Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P., that
they really were Montenegrin students. That indignant
gentleman insists that they were Serbs, armed with
French and British rifles, against which, he tells us (in
the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, January 1921) the insurgents
could not do much. Eleven of these volunteers were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>killed and they were buried underneath the tree where
Nikita used to administer his brand of justice. All kinds
of incriminating documents were found upon the dead
and captured rebels, as also a significant letter from the
Italian Minister accredited to Nikita, which was addressed
to the chancellor of the Italian Legation at Cetinje. An
inter-Allied Commission, over which General Franchet
d'Esp&eacute;rey presided, issued their report on February 8
at Podgorica. "All the troops," it said, "in Montenegro
are Yugoslavs and not Serbs; there are not more than
500 of them." It further stated that the rebellion had
been provoked by certain agents of the ex-King, assisted
by some Italian agents. As for the ridiculous Italian
charge which I quoted, accusing the French of a share
in the low intrigues of Balkan politics, this participation
consisted in their General at Kotor demanding of Darkovi&#263;,
the leader of the Montenegrin deputies, that his followers
and the rebels should not come to blows. The reply,
which annoyed the General, was to the effect that if the
rebels made an attack, then Darkovi&#263; with his scratch
forces would defend himself&mdash;and the battle lasted for
two or three days. A junior French officer, who had been
in command of a small detachment at Cetinje, told me
that the noise of firing had awakened him every night
and he had not the least idea what it was all about. But
the French had a pretty accurate idea of the nationality
of the "brigands" who on December 29 fired on the
<small>ss.</small> <i>Skroda</i> and <i>Satyre</i> near the village of Samouritch
when it was carrying a cargo of flour up the Bojana for
the Montenegrins. These vessels were sailing under the
French flag and the "brigands," about fifty in number,
were armed with machine guns. An International Commission
established these facts, as also that the Italian
ship <i>Vedeta</i> passed up the river just before the outrage
and the <i>Mafalda</i> just after it, and neither of them was
molested. In consequence of what occurred and as
practically all the supplies for Montenegro had at that
time to be sent by the Bojana, General Dufour, in the
absence of French troops, authorized the Serbs on
February 12 to occupy the commanding position of
Tarabosh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">WHAT HAD LATELY BEEN THE FATE OF THE AUSTRIANS
THERE</p>

<p>These Yugoslav troops had been detached from the
left wing of the Salonica forces and had come overland
in order to deal with the situation in Montenegro. The
Austrians had been in a woeful plight; it was regarded
as a punishment to serve in Montenegro and Albania,
not only because of the lack of amenities and the unruly
spirit of the people, but also for the reason that the officers
who came there&mdash;many managed to avoid it&mdash;were too
often causes of dissatisfaction. More complaints had
gone up from this front than from any other. The
supplies allotted by the High Command in Austria were
ample, as the Rieka depots testified, but a great deal did
not reach its proper destination. Some officers took
down their wives or other ladies, loading up the army
motor-cars with luxuries of food and grand pianos, while
the men were forced to tramp enormous distances; if
anyone fell out, the natives in Albania would emerge
from where they had been hiding and would deprive the
wretched man of his equipment and his clothing, and
perhaps his life. The sanitary section of that Austrian
army was not good; it happened frequently that victims
of malaria and wounded men were told to walk&mdash;if they
arrived, so much the better. These poor fellows did not
know that if they ultimately got back to Vienna they
might be the objects of Imperial solicitude&mdash;the least
to be dreaded was the Archduke Salvator, who was wont
to come to a hospital, with his wife, and to bestow on
every man a coloured picture-postcard of their Imperial
and Royal persons, with a sentence printed underneath
respecting their paternal and maternal love; it was
officially reported in Vienna, of another hospital, that
those who lay there had been spending "happy hours"
in "the circle of the exalted Family"&mdash;this referred
to the Archduchess Maria Immaculata, whose compositions
for the piano are said to be beyond all criticism;
she herself did not play them, but would sit there while
they were inflicted by a courtier on the helpless men.
Not very enviable was the lot of those Magyar officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
who were taken to that hospital in Buda-Pest over which
the Archduchess Augusta, a strikingly ugly woman,
presided. It was a regulation that no wounds were
allowed to be dressed until the Archduchess, arrayed in
uniform and armed with a revolver, made her appearance
of an evening. The officers were told that it was etiquette
for them to broach a pleasant conversation with their
benefactress. But the most dangerous Habsburg was
the Archduchess Blanka, who was interested in medicine;
she had thought out for herself a remedy which human
ailments never would withstand, but which was more
especially effective in cases of tuberculosis, of malaria
and of kidney diseases. At the hospital in the Kirchstetterngasse
she had a ward entirely devoted to kidneys.
Her treatment consisted in hot bandages of corn-flowers;
the patients were packed in these bandages and that was
all that was done to them. With regard to the diet,
there were no particular regulations. Some of the men
were sent from there to another and less original hospital,
but it was often too late.</p>


<p class="section">AND OF THE NATIVES</p>

<p>The Montenegrins who had been for so long&mdash;some of
them for three years&mdash;leading a congenial life among their
rocks, descending now and then to kill an Austrian and
to gather booty, were most active when the ill-starred
Imperial army was retiring. Six hundred Austrians,
for instance, took the road from Kola&#353;in with the intention
of marching to Lieva Rieka, a distance of 45 kilometres.
Thirty-five of them arrived there. Thus the population
avenged such incidents as the hanging by the Austrian
authorities of the brother of the ex-Minister General
Ve&#353;ovi&#263;,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the General having taken to the hills and his
brother being executed by way of reprisal. The Austrians
had now to pay the penalty of ruthlessness; on September
1, 1917, Count Clam Martini&#263;, the Military Governor,
issued Order No. 3110 which stated that: "In consequence
of the recent inquiry having revealed the fact that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>telegraph and telephone wires have been cut by civilians,
we make the following order:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. Persons caught red-handed in acts of sabotage
will be summarily shot, their houses will be razed
to the ground and their property confiscated by the
Military Administration Authorities.</p>

<p>"2. If the author of the outrage cannot be found,
the procedure will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; text-indent: 0em">"(<i>a</i>) The commune where the act of sabotage
has taken place will be condemned to a
heavy fine. If the sum demanded is not
paid within forty-eight hours, the cattle
will be seized.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; text-indent: 0em">"(<i>b</i>) Hostages will be taken who, if the cases of
sabotage are repeated, will be executed in
their commune."</p></div>

<p>Life under the Austrians had become unendurable.
Typhoid fever, marsh fever, typhus and dysentery assumed
such proportions that in the towns and villages one saw&mdash;apart
from such notices as Order No. 3110&mdash;no other
bills posted up on the walls but those containing advice
as to the correct way of nursing the sick. While poor
wretches were dying of hunger in the hospitals and on the
high road for want of bread, the authorities published
a recipe for the making of wheat-butter, which was a
recent discovery of German science, reputed to be very
nourishing for debilitated organisms. But the price of
a kilo (2 lb.) of wheat was 12 crowns (about 10s.). When
the epidemic of typhus, which broke out in Cetinje and
in the Njegu&#353; clan, reached alarming proportions and
spread to other districts, the medical authorities advertised
that household effects and linen should be washed with
water and potatoes. A kilo of potatoes, in the autumn of
1917, cost a price equivalent to 6s., a quart of oil cost
&pound;2, 10s., a quart of milk 5s., a kilo of coffee &pound;2, 18s. 4d.,
a yard of cloth &pound;4, 4s. to &pound;6, 6s., a pair of boots &pound;8, 7s.
An average of 200 persons&mdash;mainly women and children&mdash;were
dying every day of starvation.</p>

<p>The Austrian army in retreat was incapable of action.
It occupied a line east of Podgorica: Bioce-Tuzi-Lake
of Scutari, with very few guns. The troops were scanty,
they were weakened by malaria, etc.; but the Italians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
pursued them with great caution. The chief enemies
were Albanians and Montenegrins. The wily Austrians
gave rifles to the Albanians in order that they should
attack the Montenegrins, but they were often used against
their former owners. Then the contingents of the
Salonica army came across the mountains, and when the
Austrians went north, as best they could, the Yugoslavs
of the Imperial and Royal army&mdash;Bosniaks were well
represented&mdash;pinned on their tunics the national colours
and were greeted by the inhabitants. Arriving at Cetinje
they heard the incredible news that a Yugoslav State
had been founded, that the Austrian navy had been
handed over to the Yugoslavs, that French and Italians
were already at Kotor. During the journey to that port
the commanders were depressed, but the rank and file
rejoiced at the idea of going home. Discipline was at
an end. Thousands of rockets were fired into the air.
It was the end of the Habsburg monarchy.</p>


<p class="section">NOW NIKITA IS DEPOSED</p>

<p>The next thing for the Montenegrins to do was to
depose Nikita. By a futile proclamation that personage
had tried in October to resist the union of the Yugoslavs;
he had made a last desperate attempt to save his crown.
"I am ready to do," he said, "what my people desires."
He plaintively protested that all his life had been dedicated
to their service and now he wanted to go back to
ascertain precisely what they wished. "Montenegro,"
he had said, "belongs to a nation of heroes, who fought
with honour for the highest ideals." But when on
November 24 the Great National Skup&#353;tina met, and
when on the 26th it unanimously deposed him&mdash;the old
gentleman was wise enough to follow the advice of some
French statesmen and remain where he was. "Here am
I amongst you, dressed in our beautiful national costume,"
he said at Neuilly to his supporters, on one of the occasions
when he denied that he had been a traitor or anything
so dreadful. But being a prudent old gentleman he refrained
from uttering these words at Podgorica, where
the Skup&#353;tina had met; a better plan was to communicate
with the Press Association, in the hope that many editors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
would print his words. If it was a final anti-climax for
a medi&aelig;val prince&mdash;ah well, what is life but one long
anti-climax? He would protest against the constitution
of the Skup&#353;tina. He had by no means given his approval
to the new election laws; and if, contrary to his own
practice, the gendarmes were having nothing to do with
the urns, that was merely in order to curry favour with
the Western Powers. The deputies were chosen by the
people indirectly&mdash;that is to say, every ten men elected a
representative, and these in their turn elected the deputies.
This was not done by ballot, for Montenegro, like Hungary,
had never known the ballot. An absurd outcry was
raised by Nikita's band of adventurers and their unhappy
dupes in this country; they called the world to
witness this most palpable iniquity on the part of the Serbs,
whose armed forces had rushed across the mountains,
and the moment they arrived in Montenegro had so
overawed the population that this pro-Serb, pro-Yugoslav
Skup&#353;tina was duly chosen. Go to! Of course it was a
sad disappointment to Nikita that a Yugoslav instead
of an Italian army should occupy Montenegro. He had
telegraphed at the beginning of the War to Belgrade
that: "Serbia may rely on the brotherly and unconditional
support of Montenegro, in this moment on which
depends the fate of the Serbian nation, as well as on any
other occasion"; and since he knew, without any
telegram, that Serbia would in her turn support Montenegro&mdash;but
not the tiny pro-Nikita faction&mdash;he was
reduced to the appalling straits of a plot to force himself
upon his own people by means of a foreign army. Now
the composition of the aforementioned Yugoslav forces
should be noted&mdash;after more than six years of heroic
fighting against the Turks, the Bulgars, the Austro-Germans,
the Albanian blizzards, and again the Bulgars
and the Austro-Germans there did not survive a very large
number of the splendid veterans of Marshal Mi&#353;i&#263;, and in
Macedonia the ranks were filled by Yugoslav volunteers
from the United States. Many of these Yugoslavs
(over half of them Dalmatians and Bosnians) were included,
in the army which entered Montenegro. The
whole force at the time of the National Skup&#353;tina consisted
of about 200 men, ten of whom were Serbs from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the old kingdom&mdash;and if anyone maintains that 200 men
could impose their will upon a population of 350,000
which has arms enough and is skilful in the use of arms,
he makes it clear that he knows little of the Montenegrins.</p>


<p class="section">THE ASSEMBLY WHICH DEPOSED HIM</p>

<p>The Podgorica Skup&#353;tina was not elected by these
troops. No one will pretend that in the excitement of
those days the voting was conducted in a calm and
methodical fashion. Here and there a dead man was
elected; the proceedings&mdash;though they were not faked,
as in Nikita's time&mdash;were rough-and-ready. But if the
deputies had been selected in a more haphazard fashion,
say according to the first letter of their surnames, the
result would have been identical&mdash;they would, with a
crushing majority, have deposed their King and voted
for the merging of their country in the rest of Yugoslavia.
If the former Skup&#353;tina had been convoked, as some
people advocated&mdash;it would have most effectively nonplussed
the pro-Nikita party here and elsewhere (it might
even have silenced Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P., who asserted<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
that this "packed assembly" consisted of "Serbian
subjects and bought agents in about equal numbers")&mdash;but
then two-fifths of the country&mdash;those territories
acquired in the Balkan War&mdash;would not have been
represented. Observe, however, that the Skup&#353;tina in
Nikita's time was for union with Serbia. Even then&mdash;although
of the 76 deputies the king nominated 14,
while the other 62, of course, were people whom he
pretty well approved of&mdash;even then they had passed
resolutions in favour of an economic union, a common
army and common representatives abroad. The Podgorica
Parliament had 168 members, of whom 42 were
from the new areas. The Constitution did not provide
for such an assembly; but Nikita's friends who clamoured
for the Constitution evidently had forgotten that under
Articles 2 and 16 a king who deserts his country and
people is declared to have forfeited his legal rights.
Those foolish partisans who cried that it was monstrous
not to wait until all the interned Montenegrins had come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>back from Austria and Hungary, may be reminded of
Nikita's Red Cross parcels which these prisoners had refused
to take. Moreover, certain of them were elected, after
their arrival, as vacancies occurred, and they were also
represented among the dozen deputies whom the Skup&#353;tina
chose for the Belgrade Parliament. No disorders
happened during the elections, the best available men
were chosen&mdash;76 of them having enjoyed a university
education. It is worthy of remark that while 20 of the
Podgorica deputies had sat in Nikita's former parliaments,
another 150 of these ex-deputies survive, and yet out
of the total number of past and present deputies (<i>i.e.</i>
over 300), only 15 declared for a kind of autonomy, but
were in favour of Yugoslav union. The Metropolitan of
Cetinje, the Bishops and five of the six pre-war Premiers
gave their unreserved support to the new r&eacute;gime. With
them was the Queen's brother, the Voivoda Stephen
Vukoti&#263;, a grand-looking personage who has remained
all his life a poor man; he was questioned by General
Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey as to whether he had also voted
against his brother-in-law. "If I had seven heads and
on each of them a crown," answered the Voivoda, "I
would give them all for the union of the Southern
Slavs." ... Where was the opposition to Yugoslavia?
"The Black Mountain," said Nikita at Neuilly&mdash;"the
Black Mountain, as well as her national King, has always
pursued the same path, the only one leading to the
realization of our sacred ideal&mdash;that of National Unity."
One might object that a national King should really not
have written to his daughter Xenia on October 19, 1918,
that he would propose a republic for all the Serbs and
Yugoslavs, with the abdication of the two kings and the
two dynasties. He added that the Serbs were not ripe
for a republic, but that in advanced circles his suggestion
would be enthusiastically received, and in a short time
he would reap the benefit. "That," he wrote, "is my
impression&mdash;it may be that I am wrong&mdash;but I do not
know what else I can do." And a truly national King&mdash;but
the world, as Sophocles remarked, is full of wonders,
and nothing is more wonderful than man&mdash;a truly national
King should not have supported those twenty Montenegrins
who in the summer of 1919 assembled at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
monastery of De&#269;ani with the design of establishing a
Bol&#353;evik republic. Before the Yugoslav troops could
reach the spot these men were surrounded by Albanians
and overpowered, so that another wild dream of the old
intriguer was dissipated.... When Mr. Leiper, the
<i>Morning Post's</i> acute representative, was in Montenegro
during the summer of 1920 he found only one person
in three weeks who pined for the return of Nikita.
"Presently," he says, "we were accosted by an ancient,
wild-looking 'pope,' with a face rugged and stormy as
the crags among which he lived, and long, straggling
hair tied in behind by an old leather boot-lace.... The
talk turned to politics. My friend wailed over times
and morals. Food was scarce, the wicked flourished
like green bay trees, honest folks were oppressed, starved,
neglected; for example, his own self that sat before me&mdash;would
I believe it?&mdash;after forty years' service he had
not so much as attained the dignity of Archimandrate....
They were a rascal lot, those at present in power, ripe
for hanging, every man-jack of them. And oh for the
days of good King Nicholas, who would have given them
short shrift!" Mr. Leiper subsequently learned that
Nikita's panegyrist had spent his life in the wilds of
Macedonia, where he acted as agent and decoy of the
then Montenegrin Government. One murder, at least, for
which he received a good sum of money, could be laid
to his charge. Now he was living in retirement, hoping
no doubt for better days, and meanwhile winked at by
the tolerant authorities.</p>

<p>After the assembling of the Podgorica Parliament a
proclamation was issued by the joyous Montenegrins at
Cetinje. "Montenegrins!" it began, "the great and
bloody fight of the most terrible world war is over!
Despotism has been smothered, freedom has come, right
has triumphed.... Montenegrin arms and the heroic
deeds of our Homeland have distinguished themselves
for centuries. The fruits of these great deeds and colossal
sacrifices our people must realize in a great and happy
Yugoslavia.... Let us reject all attempts which may
be made to deprive us of our happy future and put us in
a position of blind and miserable isolation henceforth to
work and weep in sorrow.... Before us lie two paths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
One is strewn with the flowers of a blessed future,
the other is covered with dangerous and impenetrable
brambles." If any disinterested and intelligent foreigner,
say a Chinaman, had been asked whether he thought that
it was more to the advantage of Montenegro that she,
like Croatia, Bosnia and the rest, should merge herself
in the Yugoslav State or whether he considered that the
sort of federation which the ex-King had suggested would
assist more efficaciously the welfare&mdash;social, economical
and national&mdash;of the Montenegrin, he would not have
thanked you for asking so superfluous a question....
Nikita then asserted that those terrible Serbian bayonets
had caused the Podgorica Skup&#353;tina to vote as it did.
Anyone who has spoken to one of those Bocchesi or
Dalmatian volunteers who were at that time in Montenegro
will quite believe that they applauded the result, but to
pretend that they drove the Skup&#353;tina with bayonets to
do what every reasoning creature would have done is
so farcical that one might have thought it would not
even form (as it did form) the subject for questions in
the British House of Commons.... The only part
played by bayonets was when on November 7 (one day
previous to that fixed for the elections) a detachment of
the Italian army landed at Antivari and another marched
to within about six kilometres of Cetinje, where they were
met by the Montenegrin National Guard, were told that
bigger forces, which it was difficult to restrain, would
shortly arrive and were given one hour in which to depart.
Of this they availed themselves, announcing that they
were all Republicans. They left behind them an elderly
man who was sick and requested the Montenegrins not
to murder him. The Italians and Nikita's friends soon
afterwards spread a report of horrible murders in Montenegro.
Certain Allied officers went up to investigate
the matter and found that the charges were baseless.
They were told by Mr. Gloma&#382;ic, the prefect of Cetinje,
that the Allies, apart from the Italians, could go anywhere
in Montenegro, but that the Italians would be opposed
by force of arms and that if the Allies came up together
with the Italians, then they too would be attacked.
Thereupon the Allied officers invited Mr. Gloma&#382;ic to
lunch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">NIKITA'S SORROW FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS</p>

<p>Nikita had no hopes that any good would come from
such a Skup&#353;tina. In 1912 it had been different; with a
budget of some 6,200,000 perpers (or francs), including
the Russian subsidies and the revenues from the Italian
tobacco monopoly, the royal civil-list comprised 11 per
cent. of the expenses, while the police accounted for 12 per
cent., agriculture and commerce 1&frac12; per cent., public works
4 per cent. and education 5 per cent. The Skup&#353;tina of
that period had not caused him to pay more attention to
the people's requirements. The darkness in which they
lived was so profound that when Montenegro had to pay
the interest on a six-million-franc loan from Great Britain
no one in Cetinje could calculate how much was due; a
telegram was therefore sent to London asking for this
information and the date when payment should be made.
If his people did not prevent him from allocating merely
11,000 francs to the Ministry of Justice for the increase
of salaries and so forth, while the Ministry of the Interior
received 700,000 francs for the work of spying, the expense
of killing people and various propaganda&mdash;both
these items being labelled "special expenses"&mdash;then
Nikita had no fault to find with his Skup&#353;tina. Things
were almost as satisfactory as before 1907, when for the
first time a budget was issued and the people were told
how their contributions were spent. The personal
property of the sovereign had indeed been formally
separated from that of the State in 1868; but Nikita's
manipulations were so little supervised that, even when he
had established the Skup&#353;tina, he could say with truth,
"L'&eacute;tat c'est moi." The Skup&#353;tina of 1918 was going
to make vast changes.</p>


<p class="section">THE STATE OF BOSNIA</p>

<p>In Bosnia, for some time after the Austrian collapse,
it was inconvenient to travel. If you went by rail you
were fortunate if you secured a good berth on the roof of
a carriage; by road you went less rapidly and therefore
ran a greater risk of being waylaid by the so-called "Green
Depot," who were deserters from the Austrian army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&mdash;either
through national or other reasons&mdash;with their
headquarters in the forests. Some of them were simply
men who had gone home on leave and stayed at home.
Here and there a National Guard of peaceful citizens,
irrespective of nationality, was formed against them.
But it was some time before they were induced to lead a
less romantic life. What happened afterwards in Bosnia
between the Serbs, the Croats and the Moslems was so
much a matter of routine that the Italians should not
have run off with the idea that this imperilled Yugoslavia.
Of the 1,898,044 inhabitants in 1910 the proportions were
as follows: Orthodox, who call themselves Serbs, 43&middot;49
per cent.; Moslem, 32&middot;25 per cent.; and Catholics, who
call themselves Croats, 22&middot;87 per cent. (The remainder
are miscellaneous persons, such as 850,000 Jews, who speak
the usual Balkan Spanish; they play an inconsiderable
part in public life.) The Serbs, the Moslems and the
Croats are identical in race and language, but have hitherto
been much divided. Those who joined together in the
Turkish days were led to do so as companions in distress;
the rule of Austria, or to speak with greater accuracy
the rule of Hungary&mdash;no one knew exactly who possessed
the land, but the Magyars took it for granted that it was
theirs&mdash;this rule, of course, did nothing to unite the
various religions. The Moslems, especially after their
complete isolation from Turkey, were the most favoured,
while the Serbs, owing to the proximity of Serbia, were
the most oppressed. And during the War it was the
Serbian population which was chiefly tortured. Besides
all those who were dragged away to such places as Arad,
hundreds and hundreds were hanged in their own province.
Not satisfied with using, as we see in so many of those
ghastly photographs, their own army as the executioners,
the Austro-Hungarians also organized local bands among
the lower classes of the towns, and in so doing they availed
themselves of any latent religious fanaticism among the
Moslems. From the day of the Archduke's assassination
it was the Serbs who suffered most; and many onlookers
must have expected in the autumn of 1918 that they would
take a very drastic revenge. For some weeks the people
were left very much to their own devices, with no troops
or police&mdash;the Austrian <i>gendarmerie</i> having to be protected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
by the better classes, who explained to the peasants that
it was not right to regard only the uniform of those who
had so often maltreated them; yet the gendarmes took
the earliest opportunity of getting into mufti. There was
also for several months a dearth of detectives. Many of
those who had worked under Austria and were more or
less criminal, fled at the collapse; others continued to
act, but in a half-hearted way. Sixty new detectives
were taken on by the Yugoslav authorities, and fifty-six
of them had to be dismissed. After all, if one can judge
a person's character from his face, the detective who
allowed you to do so would be so incompetent as not to
warrant a trial. And after six or seven months of Yugoslav
administration only thirty-three out of fifty-two detective
appointments in Sarajevo had been definitely filled.
So there was not much restriction on the peasants in their
dealings with each other. A few of them were murdered.
In Sarajevo the National Guard was largely composed
of well-meaning street boys; the Serbian troops did not
arrive until November 6, and in many parts of Bosnia not
until the end of the month. And yet in the whole country,
with people on the track of those who in the pay of Austria
had denounced or murdered their relatives, and with the
poor <i>kmet</i> at last able to rise against the oppressive landlord,
there were in the first six months under fifty murders,
and these were mostly due to the desperate straits of the
Montenegrins, who came across the frontier in search of
provisions, during which forays they assassinated various
people. In the Sandjak of Novi Bazar there was no doubt
less security; but to anyone who knew, say the Rogatica
district, under Austria's very capable administration, it
will seem that Bosnia, after the collapse, was singularly
tranquil. Anyhow the population, in the summer of
1919, were living on much more amicable terms with one
another than for many years. The Government met
with some criticism, for it was alleged to be reserving all
the lucrative appointments for the Serbs; one had to
take into account, however, that it was the Serbs who
had been chiefly ruined by the War, and it was just that
the concessions for the sale of tobacco, for the railway
restaurants and so forth, should be, for the greater part,
given to them. Nevertheless it may interest travellers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to know that the restaurateurs at the stations of Ilid&#382;e
and Zenica are Catholics&mdash;the Moslems are not yet very
competent in such affairs. They are, as their own leaders
sadly confess, the least cultured and the least progressive
class. As elsewhere in Islam there has been a total lack
of female education&mdash;the mothers of the Sarajevo Moslem
<i>intelligentsia</i> can neither read nor write, while their sons
are cultivated people who speak several languages. A
change is being made&mdash;there are already five Moslem lady
teachers employed in the mixed Government schools;
this a few years ago would have been thought impossible.
It is to be deplored that these divisions into Moslem
and Orthodox and Catholic should be perpetrated&mdash;the
Moslem leaders look forward to the time, in a few years,
when their deputies will no longer group themselves
apart on account of their religion; but it is unwise to
introduce too many simultaneous innovations, considering
that the illiterates of Bosnia number about 90 per cent.
of the population. The Yugoslav idea will prosper in
this country; and, by the way, while you meet an occasional
Serb who hankers for a Greater Serbia, an occasional
Croat who would like a Greater Croatia, the Moslems have
no aspirations save for Yugoslavia. [They speak of "our
language," since the word "Serbian" has for them too
much connection with the Orthodox religion, the word
"Croatian" with Roman Catholicism.] They are not
indifferent to the fact that to their own 600,000 in Bosnia
they will add the 400,000 of Macedonia and Old Serbia,
together with the 200,000 of Montenegro and the Sandjak....
One was inclined to think that the least desirable
person of the new era in Sarajevo was the editor of the
<i>Srpski Zora</i> ("Serbian Dawn"); his methods had a resemblance
to those of Lenin, for he printed lists of persons
whom he called upon the Government to prosecute, and
when he was himself invited to appear in court and answer
to some libel charges he declined to go, upon the ground
that the laws were still Austrian and the judge a Magyar.
He disapproved of such tolerance, he disapproved of the
Croats because they declined to recognize that the Serbs
had more merit than they, and as for Yugoslavia&mdash;it was
a thing of emptiness&mdash;he laughed at it and called it Yugovina,
the south wind. The only chance of life it had was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
if you left the whole affair to the Serbs and then in two
years it would be a solid thing. It may be thought that
the local Government, since they left him at large, endorsed
his theories; but they were reluctant to give him
a halo of martyrdom. They imagined that he was nervous
because he was losing ground&mdash;they acknowledged,
though, that he still gave pleasure to a great many Serbs,
who were carried away by his appeals to their old prejudices.
It is undeniable that with the peculiar traditions
and customs of Bosnia, that province must for some
years have a Government&mdash;whatever method is evolved
for the other parts of Yugoslavia&mdash;whose eyes are not
turned constantly to Belgrade. It might even be well
to set up a local Chamber in which all classes would be
represented. The Moslems and Croats would thus lose
any lurking fear that they were being swamped, and by
coming into contact with other political parties even the
less cultured classes would gradually tend to discard
these fatal religious, in favour of political, divisions. A
somewhat primitive Balkan community cannot be expected
of its own accord to love henceforward in the name of
politics those whom hitherto it has hated in the name of
religion. And as yet they are much more interested in
the harvest than in politics; from day to day they change
their views, according to the views of the last orator
from Belgrade, Zagreb or Ljubljana. Only the Socialists
appear to be well disciplined. Of course the present
political parties in Yugoslavia are not wholly free from religious
prejudices, an important party, for example, among
the Slovenes being based on Roman Catholicism. But
as the Slovenes are, as yet, the best upholders of the
Yugoslav idea, it is obvious that education covers all
things, and that with the increase of education in Bosnia
the religious differences will be less important. Anything
that can be done against this tyranny is beneficial, whether
the St. George be a political orator or a schoolmaster.
And as the effects produced by the former are more rapid,
so should he be encouraged. He is, in fact, appearing
in Bosnia, he will carry away, more or less, the <i>client&egrave;le</i>
of the <i>Srpski Zora</i>, and the shattered nervous organism
of its editor, Mr. &#268;okorilo, will be, one trusts, reconstituted
and devoted, as it can be, to a nobler purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
One of its deplorable effects has been that the organ of
the Croat party, a paper called <i>Jugoslavija</i>, has been
compelled to write in a similar strain, whereas the editor,
a dapper little priest, assures one that he would prefer
a more elevated tone.</p>


<p class="section">RADI&#262; AND HIS PEASANTS</p>

<p>Those who wished that Yugoslavia would be an idle
dream have had their hopes more centred in Croatia.
They told the world that horrible affairs took place, that
there has been a revolution, several revolutions, that
castles have been sacked and that the statesman, Radi&#263;,
was imprisoned. If you met this little pear-shaped man,
who is a middle-aged, extremely short-sighted person,
with a small, straggling beard, an engaging smile and a
large forehead, you would say that surely he had spent
a good many hours of his life in some university garden
where the birds, knowing that he could not easily see
them, were in the habit of alighting for their dinner on
his outstretched hands. He is a very learned little man,
who started his career by obtaining the first place at the
famous &Eacute;cole des Sciences Politiques in Paris. But
Stephen Radi&#263; happens also to be very much interested in
politics and extremely impulsive, so that his wife and
daughter have often had to look after the bookshop,
since the Government&mdash;that of Austria-Hungary and
afterwards that of Yugoslavia&mdash;had consigned him to
prison. He probably expected nothing else, for his eloquence&mdash;and
he is an orator in several languages&mdash;has
frequently carried him along and swept him round and
round, like a leaf, not only in a direction opposite to that
which he previously travelled but flying sometimes in
the face of the most puissant and august authorities.
So, for example, he began to agitate in 1904 against the
vast territorial possessions of the Church in Croatia.
This resulted in the then Archbishop issuing an interdict
against him and his meetings&mdash;a measure which, I believe,
is still in force. He was described as Antichrist, with
the consequence that his audiences, out of curiosity to see
what such a personage might look like, became larger
than ever. For many years he was the only Croat politician<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
who gave himself the trouble to go amongst the peasants.
"In politics," said Radi&#263; to me&mdash;he said a great many
other things in the course of our first conversation, which
lasted for four hours, though it seemed a good deal shorter&mdash;"In
politics," said he, "one should not, as in art, try
to be original. One should interpret not only the living
generation but the ancestors." The peasant, who feels
what Radi&#263; expresses, has repaid him well, for there is
now no party in Yugoslavia which is more devoted to its
leader. He has taken the place once occupied by the
clergy&mdash;he is by no means hostile to the Roman Catholic
Church, but he is the foe of clericalism. "Praised be
Jesus Christ! Long live the Republic!" is the usual
beginning of one of his orations, so that his enemies accuse
him in the first place of being a hypocrite, and in the second
of holding views which cannot possibly amalgamate
with those of monarchical Serbia. But the reference to
Christ appears perfectly natural to the Croat peasant&mdash;at
an open-air meeting of 10,000 of them I saw their heads
uncovered, and all bowed in prayer for a few minutes on
the stroke of noon. As for the Republic, this first came
into the picture on July 25, 1918, when the cry was raised
at a meeting of the Peasants' party. A large number of
peasants had imbibed this idea in America&mdash;those who
emigrated have been in the habit of returning, and even
if their home is in the desolate parts of Zagorija or among
the rocks of Primorija, the coastal region. And thousands
of Croats had spent part of the War as prisoners in Russia&mdash;having
deserted from the Austro-Hungarian army&mdash;so
that they had seen how the Great White Tsar, previously
regarded as an almost divine being, could be dethroned.
Four months after this famous meeting a Convention
was held, in the American fashion, with 2874 delegates,
who represented some 100,000 people. They pronounced
themselves to be Republicans and Yugoslavs. It is quite
true that many of the farmers in Croatia have a pretty
vague idea of the Republic. "Long live Mr. Republic!"
has been heard before now at one of their meetings, while
a landowner of my acquaintance was asked by two of his
aged tenants whether in the event of this Republic being
established they should choose as President King Peter
or the Prince-Regent or King Charles. But we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
remember that in 1907 a printing press was founded by
the Peasants' party at Zagreb, and those who gave their
money for this cause were, to a great extent, illiterate.
The people are groping towards the light, and they are
willing to be told by those they trust that they have much
to learn as to the nature of the light. Republicanism was
fanned into flame by Radi&#263;'s imprisonment and other
causes, so that he says he is uncertain whether he can
now persuade them to modify their demands. But if
he tells them that in his opinion a constitutional monarchy
will meet the case, they will probably still consent to
accept his view&mdash;and this has of late come to be his
own opinion. It may very well be that he adopted the
republican idea with no other purpose than to obtain
for the peasants the social and economic legislation which
they would otherwise not have secured. And, after all,
there was something of a republican nature in Croatia's
autonomy under the Magyars. As for his imprisonment,
it was strange that the Belgrade Cabinet, who should
have known their man, treated him as if he were a De
Valera; and perhaps the conduct of a subsequent Cabinet,
that of Mr. Proti&#263;, who came out for Croatian Home
Rule, was also strange in appearance, for while Radi&#263;
was still in prison he was invited to decide as to whether
the Ban, Croatia's Governor, should or should not remain
in office. But Mr. Proti&#263; understood that at this period
Radi&#263;'s republicanism was somewhat academic.</p>

<p>His party had, in years gone by, been small enough
in the Landtag; but the fact that his followers then
numbered only two is anyhow of no importance, as his
very real power was derived from the peasants, who were
largely voteless. How often in his prison he must have
yearned for those old Landtag days&mdash;apart from his
advocacy of the peasants, he loves to speak. In two hours
he would traverse the whole gamut of human thought,
expressing opinions to which John Hampden and Jack
Cade and Montaigne and Machiavelli would in turn
assent. The words used to rush from his lips in a torrent,
while to many of his faithful peasant followers he seemed,
throughout his discourse, to be in direct contact with the
Almighty. Next to the Almighty the Croatian peasant
had been taught to revere Francis Joseph, so that when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
heir to the throne was murdered in 1914 it was not very
difficult to make the Croat peasants rise against this
sacrilege by plundering the Serbian shops at Zagreb&mdash;Austrian
officers coming with their children to look on&mdash;just
as in other parts of Croatia and Bosnia. There is as
yet within the Croat peasant a certain hostility against the
Serb and for various reasons: one of them is that he was
always taught by Austria to detest the adherents of the
Orthodox religion, another reason is that for centuries
they have had a different culture; and so, since Austria's
collapse, when it has been explained to them what is a
republic and what is a monarchy, they have often demanded
the former for no better reason than that the
Serbs prefer the latter. They were taught by Austria to
look forward to a Greater Croatia, which would eliminate
the Slovenes by delivering them to the Germans, for that
celebrated corridor to the Adriatic. And it is from the
Slovene Socialists that the peasants of Croatia might very
profitably learn.... The Slovene influence, coming
from a more highly organized province, would be beneficial
both for Serbs and Croats, for the industrial workers and
for the peasants. The nature of the Southern Slavs, say
these Socialists, is democratic, and the State mechanism
might be made more so. Now that the various parts of
Yugoslavia have liberated or are liberating themselves
from various yokes, they have approached one another
with a different mentality; they will become much better
known to one another. And it was hoped that when Mr.
Radi&#263; regained his freedom and his book-shop he would
find that his devotees preferred to hear him not as a
Croat Jack Cade but as a Yugoslav Hampden. In his
absence the party was leaderless.</p>

<p>As for the other Croats, only Frank's Clerical party,
which numbered five or six deputies, and did not hide its
persistent sympathies with the House of Habsburg, kept
up Separatist tendencies. All the Coalition (now the
Democrat) party and two-thirds of the so-called Party of
Croatian Right were for a close union with Serbia and the
regency of Prince Alexander. That is not to say that there
was perfect unanimity with regard to the interior arrangements
of this union; in fact Dr. Ante Paveli&#263;, one of the
Vice-Presidents of the Yugoslav National Council, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was received in special audience by the Prince at Belgrade,
is also the leader of the old Star&#269;evi&#263; party and as such an
opponent of complete centralization. The <i>Obzor</i>, Zagreb's
oldest newspaper, maintains this point of view, not paying
much attention to the form of the State, monarchic or
republican, so long as it is organized in a manner which
would prevent the Croats being subordinated. Zagreb,
it thinks, is destined to play the New York to Belgrade's
Washington&mdash;but nowadays it looks very much as if
Zagreb's r&ocirc;le were to be that of Yugoslavia's Boston.</p>

<p>Among the Slovenes this anxiety for decentralization&mdash;which
is very proper or exaggerated, according to the
point of view&mdash;is less accentuated. It appears as if the
Christian-Socialist party of Monsignor Koro&#353;ec<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is rather
centralist in its Belgrade words and decentralist in its
Ljubljana deeds. This party has shed some of its extremist
clerical members, who to the cry, "The Church is
in danger!" were very good servants of the Habsburgs.
Such of them as were unable to accept the new order of
things&mdash;elderly priests, for the most part&mdash;retired from
the political stage.</p>


<p class="section">THOSE WHO WILL NOT MOVE WITH THE TIMES</p>

<p>There remains the Voivodina (Banat, Ba&#269;ka, etc.) party,
some of whom are as much frightened of Croat predominance
as the <i>Obzor</i>, for instance, is of Serb. The
argument of these Voivodina politicians is that Serbia has
lost so many of her <i>intelligentsia</i> during the War that she
must have special protection; they also found it hard to
swallow the old functionaries whom the State took over
from Austria. Of course it does not follow that if a Slav
has been a faithful servant of Austria he will be an unsatisfactory
servant of the new State. Obviously the
circumstances of each case must be considered; and, as a
barrister, a dissentient member of this party told me at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>Osiek, one must often put personal feelings aside; he
himself had been arbitrarily imprisoned during the War
by an official who was then an Austrian and is now a
Yugoslav functionary. The most extreme exponent of
this anti-Croat party seems to be a well-known editor at
Novi Sad, Mr. Ja&#353;a Tomi&#263;. In his opinion you cannot
join by means of a law in twenty-four hours people who
have never been together; let it be a slower and a surer
process. He is ready to die, he says, but he is not ready
to lose his national name. Let the Serbs and Croats and
Slovenes retain what is most precious to each of them.
Let them not be asked to give up everything. In the
matter of the flag Mr. Tomi&#263; is justified, for now their
former flag has been taken from each of them and a totally
fresh one created, which is particularly hard on the Serbs
after the sublime fashion in which their old colours were
carried up the Macedonian mountains in the Great War.
It would not have required much ingenuity&mdash;as they all
three share the colours, red, white and blue, differently
arranged&mdash;to have devised, not a mere new and unmeaning
arrangement of the simple colours, but a method on the
lines of the Union Jack or of the former Swedish-Norwegian
flag, wherein all three would have remained visible. Mr.
Tomi&#263; believes that a real <i>intelligentsia</i> would demand of
the people what it can execute, and he regrets to think
that at least two-thirds of the <i>intelligentsia</i> want the
people to call themselves Yugoslavs. But Mr. Tomi&#263;
has a far greater majority than two-thirds against him,
because while his arguments would be admirable if the
Serbs and Croats and Slovenes had no neighbours, they
must be&mdash;and the vast majority of Yugoslavs feel that they
must be&mdash;superseded on account of this imperfect world.
By all means let each one of the three retain every single
custom that will not interfere with the national security
and will not interfere too much with the national welfare.
If Mr. Tomi&#263;, who is much respected but generally looked
upon as rather old-fashioned, is going to die sooner than
give up something which the State considers essential he
will be following in the footsteps of those whom Cavour,
in the course of the welding of Italy, had to execute.</p>

<p>It may be said without fear of contradiction&mdash;in fact
I was given the figure by one of the decentralization leaders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of Croatia&mdash;that at least 90 per cent. of the Croat <i>intelligentsia</i>
wants the union with Serbia, and if a republic is
decided upon they will mostly vote for King Alexander
as President. While they discuss their internal organization&mdash;no
simple matter when one considers their varied
antecedents, their different legal systems and so forth&mdash;they
will not let Yugoslavia go to pieces. The work of
construction and of more or less strenuous, but necessary,
criticism occupies by far the greater number of the
politicians. They have not yet, all of them, given their
adherence to this or that group, while new groups are
arising&mdash;such as the Agrarian, which being far more
interested in the peasant's material welfare than in anything
else will give their alliance to that political party
which is prepared to assist the villages towards improving
their cleanliness and their manure.</p>


<p class="section">THE YUGOSLAV POLITICAL PARTIES</p>

<p>The chief parties which in the new State's first two
years evolved themselves out of those that previously
existed in the various parts of Yugoslavia were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) the Pa&#353;i&#263; party, consisting chiefly of the
Serbian Old Radical party, together with Serbian
parties from the Voivodina and Bosnia.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) the Pribi&#269;evi&#263; party, consisting chiefly of the
Croatian Coalition party, together with the Slovene
Liberal party and the Serbian parties in opposition
to Pa&#353;i&#263;.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) the Christian Socialist party, under Koro&#353;ec,
consisting chiefly of Slovenes, together with a young
group in Croatia and other Clerical groups that are
forming in Dalmatia and Bosnia.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) the Star&#269;evi&#263; party, under Paveli&#263;, consisting
of decentralizing parties in Croatia and Slavonia, and
some Croats in Bosnia.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Socialists:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em">(1) the Slovene non-communistic Socialists.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em; padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -3em">(2) Korac's party, chiefly from Slavonia and
Serbia. This remarkable man, whose
mind floats serenely in a body that is
paralysed, has twice been included in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Cabinet. By many he is looked upon as
too subversive, but he believes that a
revolution will come unless his department
acts in a revolutionary fashion.
His programme includes old-age pensions
from the age of sixty&mdash;the people being
now enfeebled by the wars&mdash;and obligatory
insurance with regard to all those, including
State employees in the railway
service and the post office, who do not
enjoy an independent existence, half the
insurance being paid by the employer and
half by the employee, while with regard
to accidents the whole would be paid by
the employer. He has also very firm
ideas for the safeguarding of the human
dignity of the pensioners.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em; padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -3em">(3) Dr. Rado&#353;evi&#263;'s party. This gentleman was
said to adore Lenin, on whom he lectured.
His party had no strength except such
as it derived as a protest against any
forced centralization.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Republican party, consisting of 90,000 Croat
peasants under Radi&#263;.</p></div>

<p>Of these by far the most important were the first two.
In Serbian political parties the personal question used to
be nearly always uppermost, and now, in the case of
parties (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), it was most difficult to understand
what aims the one had which the other did not share.
One may say that each of them was a group under a wily
politician who was able, not only to forge out of various
elements a homogeneous group, but to persuade them
that there was a fundamental difference between their
group and any other. Here one has not so much the
Western system, under which a man enters a Cabinet as
the exponent of party principles, but the Eastern system
under which a Minister uses his influence to found a
party, which is based inevitably on the disappearing
relics of the past. In the spring of 1919 many foreign
observers fancied that new parties were surging up like
mushrooms and proving, no doubt, that the people's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
vitality was strong, although one would have waited
willingly for this evidence until the country's external
and internal affairs were more settled. As a matter of
fact these rather numerous parties, of which the outside
world now heard for the first time, had been in existence
or semi-existence for years. There was, however, a
certain bewildering vacillation on the part of some of the
deputies. The Bosnian Moslems, for instance, could not
make up their minds whether they would be Serbs or
Croats and belong to (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>). Finally most of them
settled down in (<i>b</i>), while two others formed an independent
group. It must be remembered that they, like
all the other deputies, were not really deputies but delegates,
since it was not yet possible to hold elections.
There would naturally be many changes after the first
General Election; for one thing, the Moslems intend to
join in one group with their brethren from Macedonia and
Novi Bazar.... As we shall see, later on, the changes
produced by the first General Election&mdash;which was
the election held in November 1920, for the Constituent
Assembly&mdash;were extremely sweeping. While the
Radicals and Democrats returned with close on one
hundred members each, the Koro&#353;e&#263; party met with
comparative disaster, and the Star&#269;evic group was overwhelmed.
With about fifty members apiece, the Communist
and the Radi&#263; parties gave expression, roughly
speaking, to the discontent produced by the unsettled
conditions&mdash;unavoidable and avoidable&mdash;of the new
State's first two years. The Moslems came back with
nearly thirty members, and a healthy phenomenon for a
country in which the peasant so largely predominates
was the success, apart from the Radi&#263; Peasant party, of
the Agrarians with some thirty deputies, and the Independent
Peasant party with eight.</p>

<p>The Italian Press disposed in five lines of the historical
Act of Union which occurred when the delegates of the
Yugoslav National Council were received by the Prince
at Belgrade on December 1, 1918. In the address, which
was read by Dr. Paveli&#263;, it is recorded that "the National
Council desires to join with Serbia and Montenegro in
forming a United National State of Slovenes, Croats and
Serbs, which would embrace the whole inseparable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
ethnographical territory of the South Slavs.... In the
period of transition, in our opinion, the conditions should
be created for the final organization of our United State."
And there is a dignified protest against the Treaty of
London and the Italian encroachments which even went
beyond that which the treaty gave them. In his reply
the Prince, among other remarks, said that "in the name
of His Majesty King Peter I now declare the union of
Serbia with the provinces of the Slovenes, Croats and
Serbs in an indivisible kingdom. This great moment
should be a reward for the efforts of yourselves and your
brothers, whereby you have cast off the alien yoke.
This celebration should form a wreath for the officers
and men who have fallen in the cause of freedom....
I assure you and the National Council that I shall always
reign over my brothers and yours, and what constitutes
the Serbs and their people, in a spirit of brotherly love....
The first task of the Government will be to arrange
with your help and that of the whole people that the
frontiers should comprise the whole nation. In conjunction
with you I may well hope that our powerful
friends and Allies will be able justly to appreciate our
standpoint, because it corresponds with the principles
which they themselves have proclaimed and for the
achievement of which streams of their precious blood
have been poured out...." The Prince spoke of Italy
in phrases to which we have already alluded.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He
reminded her of the Risorgimento and of the principles
with which her great sons had then been inspired. But
the Italian Press preferred to moralize in column after
column on the variety of the political groups of Yugoslavia,
with the object of showing to the world that they
were a people of no cohesive capacities and of no real

<p class="section">THE SLOVENE QUESTION</p>

<p>This matter of the frontiers had been very lucidly set
before the Allies with regard to Dalmatia and Rieka; it
now remained for the Slovenes to formulate their case.
From the statement given by Dr. Trumbi&#263; to the Council
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>of Ten in Paris we will take these extracts: "The province
of Gorica-Gradi&#353;ca may be divided into two different
parts, both from an ethnical and economic point of
view. The western part, up to the line Cormons-Gradi&#353;ca-Monfalcone,
is economically self-supporting. If
we estimate the population on a language basis, there are
about 72,000 Italians and 6000 Slovenes. Geographically
it is simply the prolongation of the Venetian plain.
We do not claim this territory called Friuli, which belongs
ethnologically to the Italians. The rest of this province
to the east and the north of the Cormons-Gradi&#353;ca-Monfalcone
line, which comprises the mountainous region,
is inhabited by 148,500 Slovenes and 17,000 Italians, of
whom 14,000 are in the town of Gorica, where they
constitute half the population.... The Slovenes are
an advanced and civilized people, acutely conscious of
their racial solidarity with the other Yugoslav peoples.
We therefore ask that this district should be reunited to
our State.... Istria is inhabited by Slavs and Italians.
According to the latest statistics, there were in it 223,318
Yugoslavs and 147,417 Italians. The Slavs inhabit
central and eastern Istria in a compact mass. More
Italians live on the western coast, particularly in the
towns. They inhabit only five villages north of Pola,
and their populations have no territorial unity. Istria
is territorially linked with Carniola and Croatia, whereas
it is separated from Italy by the Adriatic, and therefore
it ought to belong to the Yugoslav State.... Triest and
its neighbourhood is geographically an integral part of
purely Slav territories. The majority of this town&mdash;two-thirds,
according to statistics&mdash;is Italian and the
rest Slav. These statistics being on the language basis,
include Germans, Greeks, Levantines, etc., as Italian-speaking,
among the Italians. The Slav element plays
an important part in the commercial and economic life
of Triest. If the town were ethnically in contact with
Italy we would recognize the right of the majority. But
all the hinterland of Triest is entirely Slav. Yet the
commercial and maritime value of Triest is what chiefly
counts, and it is a port of world trade. As such it is the
representative of its hinterland, which stretches as far as
Bohemia, and chiefly of its Slovene hinterland, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
forms a third of the whole trade of Triest and is inextricably
linked with it. Should Triest become Italian it
would be politically separated from its trade hinterland,
and would be prejudiced in a commercial respect. Since
Austria has crumbled as a State, the natural solution
of the problem of Triest is that it should be joined to our
State."</p>


<p class="section">THE SENTIMENTS OF TRIEST</p>

<p>It would be futile to talk of Triest without considering
the relations between Italians and Germans. We have
seen already how at the elections they combined against
the "common enemy." But in commerce the Germans
were in need of no alliance, for the Italians have relatively
so little capital to dispose of that they were unable to
keep the Germans from attaining that very dominant
position in Italy. As the Italians have, as a general
rule, a lack of initiative and enterprise with respect to
modern industry, it was to German efforts that the great
industrial and commercial awakening of Italy and of
Triest were largely due. In that town the Italians were
principally agents; and it is to be feared that if it
ultimately falls into their hands it will become a
German town under the Italian flag. It would be the
object of the Italians to emancipate Austria from the
Yugoslavs, giving them an outlet to Triest over Italian
territory; and it would be to the Italian advantage if
Austria were joined to Germany. Therefore it is preferable
for all the Allies, except the Italians, that
Triest should be international. Conditions could then
be offered to the Austrians that would cause them to
prefer these rather than to join themselves to Germany.
But, in the opinion also of many enlightened Italians,
it is not in that country's interest that she should hold
Triest. Apart from the older publicists and statesmen,
including Sonnino, who might wish to modify their
opinions, one of the best-informed writers on Triest and
Istria, A. Vivante, a native of Triest, in his <i>L'irredentismo
adriatico</i> (1912) is a most determined adversary to an
Italian occupation of Istria or Triest; his book has been
withdrawn from circulation by the Italian Government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Other resolute opponents have been all the inhabitants
of Triest, except the extreme Nationalists. The town's
prosperity dated from the time when the Habsburgs
were driven out of Italy. Triest has not forgotten what
occurred when she and Venice were under the same
sceptre; and this it was which brought about, at Austria's
collapse, the autonomous administration in which practically
all the elements of the town participated. Only
the Irridentists then thought that Triest's liberation need
involve union with Italy and economic separation from
the hinterland on which it depends.... When the
occupation started, in November 1918, the Chief of the
Italian police summoned before him the members of the
Yugoslav National Council of Triest. Only two of them
answered the summons, whereupon a lieutenant read
them the following order from the Italian Governor:
"In view of the fact that the Italians troops have occupied
the line of demarcation and that traffic over this line is
suspended for the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy,
it is ordered that, for strategical reasons, the South Slav
National Council in Triest be dissolved and its offices
closed." The Slovenes demanded a copy of this order,
which, however, was refused. They were not allowed to
depart until the books and national emblems had been
removed from the premises of the National Council, the
doors sealed and a guard stationed. "We others,
Italians," an Italian writer had said in the <i>Edinost</i>, the
Slovene paper of Triest, on August 18, 1918, "should
understand that if we want our freedom we must see
that this is likewise given to our neighbours." And the
<i>Mercure de France</i> of October remarked that these wise
words would be listened to at Rome. In the realm of
navigation the Italians were not idle. They started at
once to negotiate with the Austrians for the sale to themselves
of the Lloyd Steamship Company, the Austro-Americana
and the Navigazione Libera, the three largest
Austrian companies. By the end of February 1919, a
Mr. Ivan &#352;vegel related in a well-informed article,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the
Italians had, by acquiring a large portion of their shares,
obtained the decisive influence in these companies. The
deal which was carried through with the assistance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Austrian Government and which, according to the
<i>Neue Freie Presse</i> of February 22, "fully satisfied the
needs of Austrian commerce," was transacted during
the Armistice and behind the back of public opinion.
Surely the Austrian mercantile marine, to which the
Yugoslavs contributed the majority of the personnel
and which they, with the other nationalities of the late
Empire, helped to build up with the aid of considerable
subsidies, should not have been permitted to fall an easy
prize into the lap of Italy, but ought rather to constitute
an asset in the liquidation of the late Austrian State and
a subject of public discussion.... In consequence of
the Italian attitude towards Austria on the one hand
and the Slovenes on the other, the Austrians made
an attack from northern Carinthia near Christmas and
despoiled the Slovenes of about half the territory they
had occupied. An American mission asked both sides
to cease from hostilities, saying that the question of
frontiers would be decided by Paris in a few weeks. Two
Americans, who unfortunately could speak neither German
nor Slovene, motored through the country, made some
inquiries, especially in the towns, and departed for Paris.
It would have been as well if, like the French farther
to the east, they had deliminated between the two people
a neutral zone. Sooner or later the troubles were bound
to recommence.</p>


<p class="section">MAGNANIMITY IN THE BANAT</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of all the lands which the Yugoslavs were
inheriting from Austro-Hungary, that which was passing
through the period of transition with the least disturbance
was the Banat. Those Magyars who stayed were saying
wistfully that it had been Hungarian for a thousand
years, but considering what they had done they could not
have brought forward a worse reason for their reinstatement.
Here and there at places near the frontier, such
as Subotica, they waylaid and murdered lonely Serbian
soldiers; after which, with the complicity of Magyar
officials whom the Serbs had not removed, they managed to
escape to Hungary. But as a rule they thought it wiser
to stay peacefully in the Banat than seek their fortunes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in a land so insecure as Hungary was then. While Count
Michael Kar&oacute;lyi's Government was doing its utmost to
cultivate good relations with France, England and America&mdash;printing
in the newspapers cordial articles in French
and English, surrounding the Entente officers even in
their despite with the old, barbaric hypnotizing Magyar
hospitality, assuming in a long wireless message to
President Wilson that the Hungarians were among those
happy people who at last had been liberated from the
yoke of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire&mdash;("I
beg you, Mr. President, to use your influence that no acts
of inhumanity or abuses of authority may threaten our
new-born democracy and freedom from any quarter.
They would cruelly wound the soul of our people and
hinder the maturing of that pure pacifism and that
mutual understanding between the peoples without which
there will never be peace and rest on earth.... We will
not discredit or delay with acts of violence the new-born
freedom of the peoples of Hungary or the triumph of your
ideas....")&mdash;at a place called Nagylak the free Hungarian
people requested the authorities to give them an official
document permitting them to plunder for twenty-four
hours; at a place called Szentes there was a car which
had been stolen from a man at Arad, sixty miles away;
hearing where it was he telegraphed to the authorities
and nothing happened; so he hired another car and went
himself to Szentes where the Magyar Commissary confiscated
this one also. It was better to remain in the
Banat if one had anything to lose. The treatment which
the Magyars received was such that Mr. Rapp, Commissary
of the Buda-Pest Government, published a proclamation
on the generous conduct of the Serbian troops
occupying southern Hungary: "Our nationals," he
declared, "though vanquished and in a minority, are
safe. The Serbian officers in command treat them in a
most humane and chivalrous fashion."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> At Pan&#269;evo,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>for example, the Magyar officials were placed, for their
protection, on board a boat by the Serbian authorities
and kept there, provided with food and cigars, for twelve
hours, after which, as the danger was past, they were set
at liberty. In the same town, forty years earlier, the
language used in the law courts had been Serbian; no
one, in fact, spoke Magyar, except the cab-drivers&mdash;if you
spoke it people said you must have been in prison. Yet,
although the Magyar judges had, to put it mildly, not
been too considerate towards the Serbs, they were retained
in office on the understanding that they would learn
Serbian within a year; nor were they asked, as yet, to
administer the law in the name of King Peter, but in the
name of Justice. This magnanimity was not displayed
because, as with the railway employees, the Serbs were
short of people for those posts, since they had barristers
well qualified to be employed, as they were, for example,
at Sombor, in the position of temporary judges. Even
the town advocate was not dismissed, although this
healthy gentleman had superseded a Serb forty-two years
of age, considerably older than himself, who had been
compelled to join the army. Not alone were all these
functionaries left in office, but the papers sent to them
were in their own language, Magyar or German. And in
return they generally were loyal to the Yugoslavs.</p>


<p class="section">TEME&#352;VAR IN TRANSITION</p>

<p>An extraordinary state of things was to be seen at
Teme&#353;var, where the Magyar mayor was one of the most
worried men in Europe. Until February 1919 he was
being asked to serve not two but several masters. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>uncertainty existed as to whether the town was under
French or Serbian military command, but that was not
a very serious question. There was at Novi Sad a temporary
Government for all the Voivodina, this was the
"Narodna Uprava" (National Government), consisting
of eleven commissaries, each over a department, who had
been appointed by the Voivodina Assembly of 690 Serbs,
12 Slovaks, 2 Magyars and 6 Germans&mdash;one deputy for
every thousand of the population. The mayor of Teme&#353;var
could have reconciled the wishes of the Narodna
Uprava and the military authorities, but there was a
Magyar Jewish Socialist, a certain Dr. Roth, who had
elected himself to be head of the "People's Government,"
and was subsequently appointed by telephone from
Buda-Pest the representative of the Hungarian Government.
Roth organized a civil guard, mostly of former
Hungarian soldiers, who&mdash;although he paid them well (since
Buda-Pest had given him 12 million crowns for propaganda
purposes), yet had a way of borrowing a coat or
cap from Serbian soldiers and, arrayed in these, holding
up pedestrians after nightfall. Roth had therefore been
granted the right to rule, but&mdash;save for the dubious
guard&mdash;his power was only that which the Serbian or
French authorities would give him. He issued many
orders to the mayor, some of which were very questionable,
as for instance when he sent provisions out of the
Banat to Hungary. This produced so great a scarcity
that the flour-mill employees thought it was the time to
go on strike; they demanded 80 per cent. increase in
wages, without undertaking to go back to work if they
received it. "I am not a politician," said the harassed
mayor, "I only want to save the town from starving."
But the Narodna Uprava would send no food, since the
town (that is to say Roth) would not acknowledge its
authority. There were many rumours as to how Roth
spent the sums from Buda-Pest, and a weekly Socialist
sheet, which he himself had founded, but had now made
over to a couple of his friends (likewise Magyar Jews),
called F&uuml;rth and Isaac Gara, started to bring charges
against its founder. Roth, whose previous resources
were not large and were well known to F&uuml;rth and Gara,
used now to frequent the fashionable caf&eacute; and indulge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
night after night, in potations of champagne, inviting
to his table not F&uuml;rth nor Gara, but the French General.
This officer, in the advance through Serbia, had captured
a great many prisoners and a very large number of guns,
arousing everybody's enthusiasm by his personal bravery,
his dashing tactics and the skill with which he executed
them. He was a most original person, who would sometimes
about midnight in that caf&eacute; at Teme&#353;var leap on to
one of the marble tables and there perform a <i>pas de seul</i>.
Dr. Roth succeeded in worming himself into this merry
warrior's good graces, and F&uuml;rth and Gara looked with
jaundiced eyes on the carouses of these two. And in their
newspaper, the <i>Teme&#353;var</i>, they said very biting things.
Thereupon Roth complained about them to the Serbian
authorities, asking that they should be sent to Belgrade.
When the Serbs did nothing he made application to
the French, and they&mdash;not aware of all the circumstances&mdash;sent
the couple under guard to Belgrade, where they
were interned. The mayor continued to receive the
orders of the various parties, and then suddenly Roth
organized a strike which lasted for two days&mdash;the railways,
the electric light, the water-supply and the shops
all joining in the movement. There was even a Magyar
flag on the town hall, and cries were raised by a procession
for the Magyar Republic. But this time he had gone
too far. An order came from Belgrade, from General
Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey, and Roth was taken in a car to Arad,
where he was deposited on the other side of the line of
demarcation.</p>


<p class="section">A SORT OF WAR IN CARINTHIA</p>

<p>But the German-Austrians in Carinthia, seeing how the
Slovenes were being treated by the Italians, could not
resist attacking on their own account; and here the most
tragic feature was that in the German ranks were many
Germanized Slovenes. This had been the case at Maribor
in Styria, where the population rose against the 70
Slovene soldiers during the visit of an American mission.
Many of those who were afterwards questioned were
obliged to admit that they were of Slovene or of partly
Slovene origin, but Austria had taken care of their national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
conscience. Had they been freely left to choose between
the two nationalities, and had they, out of admiration for
the German, selected that one&mdash;you would not endeavour
now to make them Slovenes; but of course these people
were never given the choice, and therefore every effort
should be used to make to dance that portion of their
blood which is Slovene, and sometimes all your efforts
will be fruitless. That those who fought in Carinthia
against the Slovene troops were of this origin can be seen
by the names of the officers of the so-called "Volkswehralarmkompagnien"
(<i>i.e.</i> the People's Emergency Defence
Companies). A document, marked W. No. 101, and
signed by a Captain Sandner, fell into Slovene hands on
February 21. It gives very full arrangements for these
companies in Wolfsberg and the neighbourhood. At
St. Paul, for instance, men are to gather from three other
regions, to wit 40 from St. Paul itself, 120 from Granitzthal,
60 from Lagerbuch and 30 from Eitweg; the officers
of this St. Paul contingent are called Kronegger, Andrec,
Kl&ouml;tsch and Gritsch&mdash;the last three are of Slovene origin.
These Defence Companies consisted largely of ex-soldiers,
under the command, very often, of a schoolmaster or some
such person; and if they had done nothing more than to
defend their own soil, one would have less to say about
them; but as a matter of fact they sent arms across to
their adherents in the territory occupied by the Slovenes.
Thus at Velikovec (V&ouml;lkermarkt) and Donji Dravograd
(Unter-Drauburg) shots were fired from houses which
had been armed in this way. Incursions were made
into Yugoslav territory, where the people were urged
to rise; and as these Defence Companies did not wear
any uniform their members could, if captured, protest
their innocence. The officers were given 20 crowns a
day, the men six crowns, with 5.44 a day for their keep
during the time of emergency, and four crowns daily in
addition if they went outside the garrison town. As it
would not be possible to get the commissariat at once into
working order the men were asked to bring at least
sufficient bread with them for a few days. Most of the
men had their own guns; those who had not would be
lent one at the village office on the understanding that
it was brought back there when the emergency was over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
These Defence Companies were joined in the spring by
2000 of the proletariat of Vienna who, at the railway
station before they started, were cheered by speeches on
the subject of plunder; at Graz they were joined by some
students who proposed to maintain order.... It was
in April that the Germans began nearly every day to
fire on the Yugoslav troops, regardless of the Americans,
who said that any infringement of the Armistice would
be severely punished. The Slovene bridgehead around
Velikovec was, towards the end of April, bombarded for
several days with heavy artillery, and the local commander,
on his own initiative, crossed the Armistice line in order to
seize this artillery; he did, in fact, carry off some twenty
pieces, with which he returned to his old positions. This
caused the Germans to send through Zurich most indignant
telegrams to the Entente Press, denouncing the
Yugoslavs for having flagrantly crossed the Armistice line
by 10 kilometres (cf. <i>Le Journal</i>, for example, of May 5).
In the same report they were held up as villains for having
crossed the river Drave at several points and cut the
railway line; as a matter of fact their infantry was at
least 11 kilometres to the south of the Drave, and the
artillery, of course, still farther off. This railway line,
which was the means of communication between Austrians
and Italians, was the subject of very fierce talk on the
part of the latter. All this time, be it remembered, the
Slovenes had feeble forces; and their own officers do
not pretend that they approach the Serbs as combatants.
After centuries of servitude&mdash;a more insidious servitude
than if their masters had been Moslem&mdash;they have now
awakened to devote themselves, and with great success,
to agriculture and industry. Nevertheless the old fighting
spirit of the Slav has not been quite extinguished in
them. Their opponents on May 2 made a big attack upon
Celovec (Klagenfurt) and Beljak (Villach), where they
had at their disposal the munitions of the entire 10th
Austrian army. Several battalions had come down from
Vienna, as well as 340 unemployed Austrian ex-officers,
who were clothed as infantry privates. These officers
were serving for the love of their country&mdash;up to May 1
at all events they were in receipt of no pay. The Slovene
ranks were somewhat depleted by Bol&#353;evik tracts, telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
them to go home, as there would be no more war; and
yet at Gutenstein sixty men with three machine guns,
under Lieut. Maglaj, a Slovene from Carinthia, kept
1500 men at bay from 9 a.m. till 3.30, after which they
slowly withdrew until the fighting ceased at six; a
corporal and two men of a machine-gun detachment were
cut off and concealed themselves in the shrubs of a defile.
Suddenly they heard a German company come down the
road, singing as they marched. The three men opened
fire&mdash;the Germans in perplexity stood still and then
retired in disorder. The whole German-Austrian movement
was checked by General Maister. And when the
Serbian veterans, men of all ages, with uniforms of every
shade, marched through the streets of Maribor, it was felt
that there need be no more anxiety as to that particular
frontier of Yugoslavia.</p>


<p class="section">YUGOSLAVIA BEGINS TO PUT HER HOUSE IN ORDER</p>

<p>It was not until now that Great Britain (on May 9)
and France (on June 5) formally recognized the new
Serbo-Croat-Slovene State.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> As the <i>Times</i> said, two
years afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> "it was not the Allies who created
Czecho-Slovakia or brought about the establishment of
Yugo-Slavia. These events were the inevitable result
of the previous history which the Allies could not, even
if they had desired to do so, prevent." The Americans
had not been so extremely considerate to Italy, for they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>had recognized the Yugoslav State on February 7, a few
days after Norway and Switzerland.... And how
necessary it was for the Yugoslavs to have some leisure
for their home affairs, which presented so many complications.
Here one system of laws and there another&mdash;with
the best will in the world and waiving to the
uttermost one's own idiosyncrasies, the Serbs and Croats
and Slovenes were faced, at the beginning of their union,
by most arduous problems. The Agrarian question was
regarded generally as one of the most urgent. In Serbia
itself, with practically the whole country in the hands of
small peasant proprietors, this question did not arise;
but in the provinces which had been lately under Austria-Hungary
no time was to be lost, and yet a good deal of
time would be needed to cope with a problem so full of
complications. One difficulty was that each political
party was inclined to solve this matter in accordance
with its own interests. Among the three Slovene parties,
for example, the Socialists would naturally work for their
own principles, the Christian-Socialist party, whose
supporters were chiefly the small farmers, would prefer
to legislate for them, while the Liberal party, having in
its ranks the larger landowners, would wish that all,
except the very largest, should if possible be left intact;
the very large landowners, moreover, will with the spread
of democratic ideas lose their influence over the voters.
There are several points on which all parties are agreed:
thus, it is most undesirable that a man's holdings should,
as now, be separated from each other, often by considerable
distances, so that half his time may be spent in
going to and from his fields and a good deal of the other
half in the disputes which naturally spring from such a
scattered ownership.... In Bosnia, where the Agrarian
troubles had produced such frequent outbreaks and
savage repression, the Austrians were given the mandate
in 1878 in the hope that they would regulate this matter.
They did not do very much; all that they really did
was to modernize a little. They wrote down in a book
who was the landlord and who were the kmets, and a
copy of these details was available for each one of the
kmets. He had the right to remain where he was&mdash;unless
his conduct was exceptionally bad&mdash;and to retain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
two-thirds of the produce of the land. This kmet-right
was not hereditary in the female line; but the kmet
could buy his portion&mdash;this was an old right, which
Austria regulated&mdash;and become a free man, a beg. He
would sometimes be a free man in one place and a kmet
in another. In Bosnia there are, of course, some extremely
large landowners; but most of the begs are
poor folk, who live on the third part of a few farms.
It would be better if these men were not compensated
with cash, but rather that they should be established on
farms which they would work themselves, the distinction
between the small begs and the kmets thus disappearing.</p>


<p class="section">THE PROBLEM OF AGRARIAN REFORM</p>

<p>A special Ministry was created to supervise, throughout
Yugoslavia, the question of Agrarian Reform; but
the Cabinet was frequently engaged in discussing this
important topic and, many months afterwards, when
the ownership of a good deal of the land had been changed,
it was acknowledged that the problem had been attacked
more often than it had been solved. Mr. Pa&#353;i&#263;, who
does not believe in hasty legislation, pointed out that
the Austrians had in forty years done really very little
in Bosnia. He was told, however, that in Croatia, for
example, the revolutionary spirit at the end of the War
was so intense that if the Government were to postpone
the necessary reforms then the people would simply
seize whatever land they wished to have. It is true
that violence was rampant in those parts&mdash;the peasants
believed that with Austria's collapse there would arrive
the Earthly Paradise, and in order to bring this about
they ravaged a good many fine estates and set fire to
various castles. They were going to stand no nonsense.
At a place called Lubi&#353;ica in Croatia&mdash;where the 350
families lived in 260 houses&mdash;the landowner, out of the
goodness of his heart, bestowed twenty "joch" of meadowland
on the village in 1864. A law was passed which
obliged him to devote a certain amount of land to the
support of the church and the school&mdash;he gave the
identical twenty joch. And at the end of the War the
peasants maintained that at last this land was going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
be restored to them; they drove their cattle on to it,
but the priest with the help of <i>gendarmerie</i> drove them
off again. Once more the cattle came back and then the
priest seized a gun; he fired at his parishioners and
wounded in the head a sixteen-year-old boy, as well as
three other persons. This so enraged the village that
they went in a body and slew the priest.... And the
authorities, although at that period they were faced with
so many problems, attempted to settle right away this
very complicated question. The Dobrovoljci&mdash;volunteers
with the Yugoslav forces who had come home from the
United States, Canada and Australia or who had managed
to escape from the Austro-Hungarian army&mdash;had been
promised so many acres, each of them, after the War.
And these Dobrovoljci and the agitated peasants found
that the land was, so to speak, thrust upon them. A
lawyer-politician would take a map, would assign a
certain area to A, another to B, and imagine he had done
a good morning's work; but unhappily the lawyer often
forgot that a farm, to be of any use to its tenant, must
have a road leading to it, must have a well, a cart, a horse,
some oxen and so forth&mdash;to say nothing of a dwelling-place.
Thus it would happen that the new tenant would
go to look at his holding and in disgust would go away,
or&mdash;contrary to law&mdash;would sublet it or sell it back to
the original owner. If, on the other hand, he remained
the State would, from an economical point of view, only
benefit in those regions where the land had hitherto
been more or less uncultivated; where it had been
cultivated by the moderately large or the very large
landowner it always returned a harvest more considerable
than that which the new tenant, insufficiently
equipped and experienced, was able to achieve. Not
only would there be this diminished production&mdash;frequently
in the proportion of six to ten&mdash;but a large
number of employees were thrown out of employment:
sometimes a clever Czech overseer, whose family of six
children had almost become Croat, and sometimes a
native farmer whose house was wanted for the Dobrovoljci.
The Czech would return to his own country and
the dispossessed farmer would become a Communist.
Yet these material and human losses to the State might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
have been endured if there had been a compensating
political advantage, that is to say if the new tenants
had been satisfied. But in far too many instances they
were not. And one cannot help thinking that, in the
vast majority of cases, they themselves would have
preferred to wait until the Peasants' Co-operative Associations&mdash;such
as flourish in Denmark&mdash;had been established.
It need scarcely be said that, from the point of view of
the peasant and of the State, these associations are an
absolute necessity. The most deplorable example of the
measures that were taken in such haste is seen, of course,
in a model-property, such as that of Count &#268;ekoni&#263; in
the north of the Banat, where the new tenants, seeking
as elsewhere to satisfy only their own wants and paying
no heed to any possible exports, allow a highly developed
property to go in a retrograde direction. If the Dobrovoljci
had been skilled agriculturists there would have
been no harm in settling them on this excellent estate;
and with a Co-operative Association the 3000 joch of
sugar that were grown there during the War would not
now be reduced to 88 joch. But as it is, what with the
unfortunate inexperience of most of the new tenants
and their lack of means, and what with the stupidity of
the local authorities who left to the previous owner one
field here and one field there in the most absurd fashion,
it would have been better both for Count &#268;ekoni&#263; and
for the State if he had simply presented to the Dobrovoljci
half his land. A great many mistakes have been made
in this question of Agrarian Reform, one of the most
cardinal being&mdash;as Radi&#263;, the spokesman of the Croat
peasants, has pointed out&mdash;to bestow the land not on
people because they can farm it, but because they were
heroes in the War.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It is a matter for congratulation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>that the measures now in force are not definite&mdash;the final
dispositions will be taken in two or three years.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And
perhaps then some part of the counsel of Radi&#263; may be
adopted&mdash;Radi&#263;, whose critics are never weary of denouncing
him for being a demagogue, a firebrand and
various other things, but who by that time may very
likely be a Cabinet Minister. He advises that there
should be a compromise, that the ownership of land in
Yugoslavia should not be strictly individualist nor
strictly communist, but that while preserving the spirit
of the <i>zadruga</i> (ownership by the community) there
should also be the mobility of individual ownership.</p>

<p>But in the field of Agrarian Reform there has been
one excellent plan, the transference of men from the
unfertile districts of Montenegro and Lika, also of landless
men from the Banat and Ba&#269;ka, as also Serbs from Hungary
and Slovenes from Istria, to those parts of Kossovo and
Macedonia which were lying ownerless. The Albanians
in Kossovo are mostly shepherds, and the land, which by
Turkish law had belonged to "God and the Sultan,"
was now at the disposal of the Yugoslav authorities.
Down to the spring of 1922 they had placed some 35,000
persons in these regions, the Montenegrins being generally
allocated to an Albanian neighbourhood, for they are
accustomed to the idiosyncrasies of the Shqyptart. At
first the Albanians viewed the new settlers with disfavour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>but now so great a sympathy has developed between
them that on various occasions the Montenegrins have
remonstrated with the gendarmes for the excessive order
they enforce and which, the Montenegrins say, you
really cannot ask of an Albanian. Against the Montenegrins
the Albanians do not care to use their rifles, since
the custom of blood-vengeance is in the Montenegrin
blood. In fact, these Albanians are very fair neighbours,
the most unruly of them living in the mountains of
the frontier. And the Montenegrins have been showing
that when they are not compelled to live with weapons
in their hand they can be quite industrious. There has,
till now, been more colonization of Kossovo than of
Macedonia; but there are wide tracts of country around
Skoplje which will be settled, once they have been freed
from malaria. The political consequences that this will
have on Macedonia, by the stabilization of economic
conditions, the supersession of the wooden plough by
the steam plough&mdash;in fact, the advent of a new European
spirit need scarcely be enlarged upon. In Serbian
Macedonia, or South Serbia as it is now officially called,
more than seven million acres of good soil are as yet
not being used.</p>


<p class="section">FRENZY AT RIEKA</p>

<p>As the months rolled on at Rieka the Italianists
became more frantic. Their telegrams to Rome, in which
they begged for instant annexation, were in vain, and after
all, what was the use of adopting the system of Lieut.-Colonel
Stadler, their energetic podest&agrave; at Abbazia, who
would go into the hills, accost the peasants and instruct
them that they must not say: "It will be settled by the
Paris Conference," but rather&mdash;"It has been settled
by the Paris Conference." All the world was learning
what was the position of affairs at Rieka; one of the most
important of these plaguy Allied officers had said that
when he first came to the town he thought it was Italian,
but he had soon perceived that it was all a comedy,
and the Italianists were dreadfully afraid that memoranda
and statistics and what not had been dispatched to Paris
and that there was the faintest, awful possibility that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
one could say: "It has been settled by the Paris Conference."
Everyone, alas! was studying the case&mdash;one
heard that Cardinal Bourne, in the course of being f&ecirc;ted
at Zagreb, was reported to have shown himself quite
intimate with Croatian history and to have discussed
especially the story of Rieka. But by far the shrewdest
blow to the Italianists was Wilson's Declaration. What
had his emissaries, who had listened with such care to
everybody, told him? One must have a grand procession
through the town to show the whole world what
the people wanted! As for Wilson, it was good to hear
the lusty shouts of the "Giovani Fiumani": "Down
with Wilson! down with redskins!" Some of the
demonstrators, after shouting that Wilson was a donkey,
a horse, a ruffian, would acclaim the new suggestion,
that their enemy was not Wilson at all but Rudolf of
Austria, who was still alive. Another very good idea
would be to have great posters made with Wilson's
head crowned by a German helmet, and now, of course,
the Hotel Wilson must become the Hotel Orlando. Let
them put a large black cross on all the Croat houses of
Rieka&mdash;well, on second thoughts, next morning, that
was not a very brilliant idea, because the crosses were
too numerous; so let the soldiers rub them out again.
And where the Croat names on banks and shops and
elsewhere had been effaced, demolished&mdash;one could hide
them by long strips of paper which they were so busy
printing: "Either Italy or death!" "Viva Orlando!"
"Viva Sonnino!"&mdash;those papers were the best reply
to people who were asking if the entire Italian Cabinet
was in harmony with Sonnino. Not merely in harmony&mdash;the
Cabinet <i>was</i> Sonnino and more particularly Orlando
was Sonnino. An Italian major came out on to a balcony
one evening, in uniform, and opened his Italian heart
to the crowd. What would the Allies say to that?
The <i>Dante Alighieri</i>, the great dreadnought, man&oelig;uvring
with her searchlights, let them rest awhile upon the
<i>Schley</i>, an American destroyer. What would the Yankees
do? "Avanti Savoia!" Perhaps in the old days they
would have sent a shot or two into the searchlights,
just for luck, but now they did nothing. And what a
scene at the Opera when <i>Andr&eacute; Chenier</i> was performed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and one of the singers came to the word "Traitor!"
and some one shouted "Wilson!" and the whole house
shouted "Wilson!" and the singer, forced to repeat
the blessed word, added amid indescribable enthusiasm
the name of the President, that ignominious President
concerning whom it was revealed by one of their newspapers
that he must obviously have pocketed Yugoslav
money, perhaps a million, and who most probably had
a Yugoslav mistress&mdash;when that opera-singer had emended
the phrase, did that very exalted Italian officer leave
his box? Why, no&mdash;he stayed until the end of the
performance.... Did any Italian in Rieka read to the
end a small and lucid American book, <i>Italy and the
Yugoslavs, A Question of International Law</i>, by C.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;H.
Bartlett of the New York and United States Federal
Bar? "It is an admitted fact," says Mr. Bartlett,
"that Italy at the outbreak of hostilities had no rights
to, or in, the territory to which she now makes claim.
Her title, therefore, has arisen since the commencement
of the War, and must be founded on either effective
possession legally acquired or on documentary evidence
or some other right recognized by international law."
And quoting Professor Westlake (<i>International Law</i>,
Part I. p. 91) as to the four grounds on which a State
may vindicate its sovereignty over new domain, he discusses
the position in the Adriatic, and concludes that
Italy can claim no title by occupancy, cession, succession
or self-determination. We refer elsewhere to Mr. Bartlett's
commentary on the London Treaty, which is the instrument
invoked by the Italians for their claims to Dalmatia.
With regard to Rieka, which, as everybody knows, was
not included even in the London Treaty, Mr. Bartlett
says that while "admitting, for the purpose of argument,
that the seizure has since resulted in an effective possession,
yet, as that is not sufficient in itself to give title,
it has no legal or effective force, but can be compared
with nomads squatting on the roadside and then claiming
a right to the soil. Italy was ashamed to assume the
responsibility for the original appropriation of Rieka,
which was made in violation of every legal right of those
to whom it belongs, and she might well be, for a more
audacious, unjustifiable proceeding in violation of every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
principle of international law it is difficult to imagine." ...
As for the Italian National Council, listen to the stirring
sentences of Mr. Grossich, its old President, after they
had unanimously voted on May 17, and with passionate
conviction, an order of the day directed to Orlando.
In that order it was stated that they looked upon the
plebiscite of October 30, 1918, as an indestructible,
historical and legal fact. Grossich exposed the situation
and was then for some instants mute. His voice was
trembling when he spoke: "The sacrifice which circumstances
may demand is tremendous, but if it is required
by the supreme interests of Italy we will know how to
support it. More than a citizen of Fiume, I feel myself
an Italian" ("Primo che fiumano mi sento italiano").
At this point the old patriot broke into tears. "Fiume
will defend herself with arms against all those who desire
to violate her will, her national conscience. Seeing that
her tenacious, indestructible Italianity is a grave impediment
for Italy in the attaining of other objects, let Fiume
be left to look after herself, sure as she is of her sons,
prepared as she is, to-day more than ever, to sacrifice
herself. She will defend herself against all and from
wherever they come." Those who listened thought
that this must mean that either the <i>Pester Lloyd</i> of
April 29 was lying when it printed an official message
stating that General Segr&eacute;, the Italian representative
at Vienna, had in the name of his Government requested
the Hungarian Soviet Republic to undertake
the care of Italian subjects in Rieka, or else that the
Magyars had told him that the 22,000 or 23,000
Italian soldiers in Rieka ought to be sufficient, as this
was practically one soldier for every person who had
been described as an Italian. But the I.N.C. had now
resolved to take no risks; they entered into negotiations
with Sem Benelli, a well-known poet of the school which
some critics call enlivening and other critics call inflammatory.
Anyhow, on the afternoon of June 13,
Mr. Benelli was made a citizen of Rieka, a member of
the central committee and was entrusted with the portfolio
of Minister of War, that is to say Commissary for
Defence. He thanked the I.N.C. in a long speech, and
declared that his appointment was the wedding of Rieka<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and Italy. Then Dr. Vio proposed a law, respecting
the defence to the uttermost of Italian rights&mdash;that an
army should be created and that the expenses should be
met by the issue of bonds for a hundred million lire.
The citizen Benelli was asked to undertake the organization
and the command of the army.</p>


<p class="section">ADMIRAL MILLO EXPLAINS THE SITUATION</p>

<p>Farther down the coast and on the islands the Italians
seemed, with few exceptions, to have relinquished every
effort to make themselves popular with the Slavs. Of
course one naturally hears more of the cases of tension
than of those where friendliness prevails; but in the
towns or villages where the Slav <i>intelligentsia</i> appreciated
that an officer was doing his best, they were obliged invariably
to add that he was doing it in spite of his men,
and that his control of these men was more or less defective.
Numbers of the soldiers, marines and carabinieri may have
been animated, when they landed in Dalmatia, with
excellent intentions, but their months amid an alien population
had produced in them too often a deplorable effect.
It must be taken into account that many of them had
an almost insurmountable desire to be demobilized. At
Gradi&#353;ca, where many Slovenes were interned, with
fences round them but with no roof other than the sky,
their guards with other soldiers had risen in revolt. This
outbreak was suppressed, certain soldiers&mdash;some say sixty,
but the number is doubtful&mdash;being shot; and all the
others took an oath that on the first occasion of a deserter
being shot at, they would, down to the last man, leave
the barracks. This movement had been growing since
the withdrawal of Bissolati from the Cabinet. As for the
young officers, they had been exhorted, in a communication
from Admiral Millo, the Governor, that they must realize
the position they were in. The Admiral's memorial,
which was marked with wisdom but also with a too-sweeping
air of superiority, was labelled "Secret Document:
No. 558 of Register P. Section of Propaganda.
Sebenico, March 21, 1919." A copy was found by the
Yugoslavs under an officer's mattress, was transcribed and
replaced. Since it made admissions with regard to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Croats the contents were telegraphed to Paris. It is a
lengthy and to us at times a rather rhetorical expos&eacute;,
of which it will suffice to make some extracts. "The
Officer," says Admiral Millo, "should place himself in a
calm and dignified fashion outside and above the disputes
which divide the sentiments of the local population. And
in accounting, psychologically and historically, for the
detestations and the aspirations of either party, he
must regard the situation with the serene mind of a judge....
The position of officers is extremely delicate, more
particularly in the small centres. It is known that outside
the towns the population in its great majority and often
its totality consists of Yugo-Slavs or Slavs of the South,
that is to say, Croats or Serbo-Croats. It is a people
of another race, of that formidable Slav race which for
centuries has been pressing against the West, athirst for
liberty and eager for the sea; a people with a psychology,
a mentality, a civilization, habits, traditions, a national
consciousness and a quite special individuality. This
population is fundamentally good, good as simple and
primitive people are. But the simple and primitive
peoples are also extremely sensitive and suspicious and
violent in their impulses.... May Heaven preserve the
officers from not taking these things into account and
from letting themselves be guided solely by their Italian
feelings.... Firm nerves, sangfroid and an evenly-balanced
mind are required in order to prevent the hostility
of the population from causing, as a reaction, resentment
and a spirit of revolt, of vengeance and of oppression on
our part. The officer must ... become an element of
moderation and pacification, with the object of assuaging
and obviating the bitter feelings which have been created
and fed by a past that is and must be wiped out for ever;
and of dissipating that hostility which, determined by
a political situation and events, has been and is being
incited and strengthened by blind passions and an
artificially created campaign of interested parties (<i>da
artificiose interessate campagna</i>).... It must be remembered
that this is the first contact (<i>il primo contatto</i>)
which the population, as yet primitive and uncultured in
its mass, has had with Italy, where it instinctively sees the
enemy and the new oppressor. We must do our best to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
make them see in Italy their friend and liberator.... It
is evident and it leaps to the eyes of all how delicate and
important is the moment of this first contact. Nothing
more than a superficial knowledge of the circumstances is
needed for the officer to understand that in all his official
and personal acts he must behave in such a manner that
the population, which is primitive and simple and therefore
all the more susceptible to suggestions, should
regain the impression that Italy is a great country, the
country of liberty and right, that its people is educated
and civilized, that its officers and soldiers are here to fulfil
a work of civilization and education, of love, in a country
which must be Italian on account of historic rights and
for the exigencies of Italy's defence: in which the Slavs,
who have been introduced by the course of events and as
an effect of the expansive potentiality of their race and the
artifices of those who dominated the country, will find in
the independence and development of their nationality
a great fatherland which is civilized, powerful, humane
and free.... In estimating the enmity of the Croats
the fact must be taken into account that the Croatian
world, I mean to say the Croat people, with its action in
the interior of Austria while the Italian army was acting
outside, resolutely and victoriously, has co-operated in
precipitating the downfall of Austria and in freeing itself
from a detested r&eacute;gime; particularly in the last year of
the War this sentiment of nationality became accentuated
with the fervent aspiration for liberty.... These are the
circumstances which have determined a special psychology
composed of joy and ecstasy&mdash;both elements which, in minds
that are laden with all the influences of the East, produce
a facile and dangerous excitement. On the other hand
there survives in the Italian population the hatred against
the Croatian supremacy, a hatred which is comprehensible
but which in time must give place to other sentiments,
rendering possible a fair coexistence of the two populations,
whose aim should be common&mdash;the prosperity and
development of Dalmatia, in the prosperity and for the
prosperity, in the greatness and for the greatness of Italy.
From this picture it must be instantly clear to every officer
that his duty here is ... a truly lofty mission of civilization....
Especially the officer who is in charge of administrative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
work must awaken impressions that are naturally
caused by the sense of justice for all; his severity
must be good and his goodness must be severe, and from
every act there must transpire the dignity which comes
from the might and right of Italy, the kindness and generosity
which come from the virtue of the race.... There
is already an impression on the part of the Croats that the
Italians are good, that Italy is strong. There must also
be born and reinforced the other conviction that we are
not oppressors but liberators.... The best propaganda,
the most efficacious, because spontaneous and unexpected,
is done by the officer and his men. The Italian officer ...
with the harmony of manners which distinguishes him,
obtains very easily the sympathies of this population, a
sympathy, however, which for an optimist may become
dangerous. Young officers must not forget that the propagators
of the great Yugoslavia still exercise with their
megalomania a potent influence over the primitive population
and that a gesture of theirs, a word, an attitude,
may even yet indirectly favour the Croat cause and make
difficulties for us in exhibiting our mission of civilization."</p>


<p class="section">HIS MISGUIDED SUBORDINATES AT &#352;IBENIK</p>

<p>It is strange that this order should have been so
scurvily treated in the town of &#352;ibenik, where it was
issued and where the Admiral resided until the beginning
of June, after which he transferred the seat of government
to Zadar. At &#352;ibenik, by the way, the population comprises
13,000 Yugoslavs and 400 Italianists. On February
20, 1919, there arrived from Zadar, in consequence
of an invitation from Admiral Millo, the Italian professor
Domiaku&#353;i&#263; who, according to the sixth clause of the
Armistice, was justified in assuming the functions of school-controller,
but was not authorized to become the inspector
or in any way to interfere in didactic matters. Two inspectors
existed in Dalmatia, one for the elementary and
one for the secondary school, but the chief school authority
of the province and the two inspectors under him were
not informed of Professor Domiaku&#353;i&#263;'s nomination. If
the Governor intended him to abide by the stipulations
of the Armistice, he must have been astonished at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
schools being shut on the day after his arrival. And
they remained shut, both the modern school and the
middle-class girls' school for months, because the Professor's
quite illegal attempt to usurp the inspectorship
was resented. The secondary school was closed and the
teachers who had come to &#352;ibenik with their families,
but whose permanent domicile was elsewhere, received an
order, delivered by carabinieri, that they would have to
leave the town in four days. A few Italians were brought
from Split and the school was reopened, but the attendance,
which had been about 200, was now 24, and of
these only two were the sons of Yugoslavs&mdash;but Yugoslavs
who had taken office under the Italians, one as President
of the Court of Justice and the other as prison inspector;
these gentlemen took their boys by the hand and led
them to school. Perhaps the Admiral was unaware of
these transactions; but various Yugoslav officials, whose
salaries had been withheld because they would not sign
a paper asking to be made Italian officials, continued,
notwithstanding, at their posts for two months; after
which the Government perceived that by the clauses of the
Armistice they were compelled to pay them. Each of
them received exactly what was due, while some Italian
teachers who had signed the paper were given a war
bonus, extending over five months, of 80 per cent.
Whether the Admiral knew of this or not, it does not
harmonize with his exalted sentiments. And the town-commandant
spoke very darkly<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> on various occasions to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>the leading citizens of what would come to pass if the
Italians by any chance were told to leave the place. His
brave fellows, the arditi, so he said, had plenty of machine
guns and of ammunition. But this fair-haired German-looking
officer was a rampageous sort of person who discharged,
according to his lights, the Admiral's "truly
lofty mission of civilization." It was not he, but another
of the Admiral's subordinates at &#352;ibenik, who, when <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'aproached'">approached</ins>
by a certain Mr. Iva&#353;a Zori&#263; with the request
that something might be done to release his son, a prisoner
of war in Italy, replied: "Your son shall be released in
eight days, provided that you declare, in writing, that you
are content with the Italian occupation." On Mr. Zori&#263;
saying that he was unable to do this, "Very well," said
the officer, "then your son will be one of the last to be set
free."</p>


<p class="section">THE ITALIANS WANT TO TAKE NO RISKS</p>

<p>Altogether one might say that the schoolmasters were
being treated in a manner that was at variance with the
Admiral's document. To give a few examples: Ivan
Grbi&#263;, the schoolmaster at Sutomi&#353;cica, was arbitrarily
imprisoned and was afterwards removed to another school
at Privlaka. The Government school at the former
place was closed, an Italian private institution being
opened in the same building, with a teacher who was
devoid of professional qualifications. The pupils of the
school which had been dissolved were compelled by
soldiers to attend the new Italian school. The elementary
schools at Zemunik were likewise closed and the schoolmasters,
after a period of imprisonment, taken to another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>village. If in the rather dreary little Zemunik, where
there is not one Italian, the schoolmaster was very
dangerous to the might of Italy, let us compare with this
the conduct of the Slovene authorities who <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'permittep'">permitted</ins>
more than one priest of the old r&eacute;gime to remain in office&mdash;one
of them at a village four or five miles from Ljubljana&mdash;though
they knew that these clergy were wont from the
pulpit to utter disloyal sentiments. Maybe the Slovene
Government was unwise, but they had scruples in removing
a priest; and moreover, they had not given up the hope
that these gentlemen would by and by change their
opinions. On the island of Pag the schoolmaster Buratovi&#263;
and his wife, who was also a teacher, had to fly in order
to escape imprisonment. The schoolmaster Grimani of
the same place was obliged, with his wife, to follow the
example of Buratovi&#263;, so that the school was necessarily
closed; and an Italian school was started in this island
with its 0&middot;31 per cent. of Italians. The same edifying
scenes must have taken place as in so many Magyar
schools where the pupils&mdash;Serbs, Slovaks, Roumanians
and so forth&mdash;did not understand what the teacher
was saying. The Government of the occupied part
of Dalmatia appointed to the elementary schools at
Rogoznica and Primo&#353;ten two young Italian law-students
from Zadar, who had no pedagogic qualifications; and
whereas the legal annual salary was 1080 crowns, these
lucky young men were in receipt of 625 crowns a month,
which covered more than handsomely any depreciation
in the currency. But now to another subject:</p>

<p>In the early part of 1919 a plebiscite was organized
by a delegation which the representatives of the occupied
communes elected at Split on January 11. According
to the census of 1900 the occupied territory contained
35 communes, divided into 398 localities, with 297,181
inhabitants. In 35 localities, with 14,659 inhabitants,
the census was prevented by the Italians, who also confiscated
the results of the plebiscite in the commune of
Obrovac.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The delegates were therefore successful in
canvassing 95&middot;07 per cent. of all the inhabitants. In
34 communes the majority for union with Yugoslavia
was over 90 per cent., while in 24 it exceeded even 99 per
cent. At Zadar (the town) out of 14,056 inhabitants
6623 (= 47 per cent.) voted for Yugoslavia, while in
the suburbs, with a larger population, the majority was
89&middot;57 per cent. In the islands the majorities ranged from
96 per cent. to 100 per cent. And if any doubts were
entertained as to these figures, the delegates were authorized
to propose another plebiscite under the control of a
disinterested Allied Power.</p>


<p class="section">YET THEY ARE INCREDIBLY NONCHALANT</p>

<p>Dalmatia, as is shown by the number of emigrants,
is not a wealthy province; and one would have supposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>that if the Italians thought it necessary to occupy a
country whose inhabitants were so unmistakably opposed
to them, it would have been&mdash;to put it at the lowest&mdash;politic
to hamper no one in the getting of his livelihood.
Austria had established fourteen military fishing centres
(besides others in Rieka, Istria, etc.), and these the
Croats joined most willingly, as a means of avoiding
service in a hated army. After the war, when their nets
were worn out, Italy supplied her Chioggia fisherfolk with
new ones. Owing to the conditions of the Triple Alliance,
the Italians enjoyed the right to "high-sea" fishing, that
is to say, the fishing up to three miles from the Dalmatian
coast; but now the Italian boats occupied all the rich
fishing grounds among the northern islands. These
dispossessed natives were originally more preoccupied with
fish than with Italians. Is it strange that they refused
to see that Italy was, in the words of Admiral Millo, the
friend and liberator?... A German firm, the Steinbeiss
Company, had built in Bosnia a very narrow-gauge line
for the exploitation of its forests; during the War this
line was continued to Prijedor, and with great difficulty
it had served for the transport of food-stuff and passengers
from Croatia: on the Croatian lines up to Sissak normal
gauge; from there to Prijedor narrow gauge; from there
to Knin very narrow gauge, and from there to Split or
&#352;ibenik narrow gauge. Thus with the loading and unloading
between 30 per cent. and 50 per cent. of the goods
were lost; but when Italy sat down at Rieka the inhabitants
of Dalmatia looked to this line. At Prijedor
hundreds of waggons of wheat and corn were waiting to
be forwarded, and with Italy blocking the road at Knin
they simply perished.</p>


<p class="section">ONE OF THEIR VICTIMS</p>

<p>The Italian administration of Dalmatia&mdash;economically,
politically, scholastically, ecclesiastically and financially
(as we will show)&mdash;was thoroughly mistaken. Wherever
one goes one is overwhelmed with evidence; it is impossible
to print more than a tithe of it. But the mention
of Knin recalls the case of Dr. Bogi&#263;, who was deported
to Sardinia for political reasons. On January 1 he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
arrested, together with a Franciscan monk, a schoolmaster
and others, transported to &#352;ibenik and put into a cell
devoid of bed, light or a window. Thence, with nothing
to eat, although the weather was wintry, he was taken
on to the <small>s.s.</small> <i>Almissa</i>, bound for Ancona. Near &#352;ibenik
the boat collided with the isle of Zlarin; he and the other
prisoners attempted to get out of their cabin, but carabinieri
kept them there by flourishing revolvers in their
faces. At Ancona, Spoleto, Perugia, Florence and Leghorn
the doctor was always lodged in prisons, had his
finger-prints taken, had to stand up to salute the warders,
had to look on while his things were stolen&mdash;at Ancona,
for instance, they despoiled him of eighty cigars. His
wrists were always bound; he was attached not only to his
fellow-travellers but to Italians who were under life-sentences.
The carabinieri cut up their bread, put it on
their knees and then, without unbinding the ropes, left
them to eat it as best they could. The journey was very
slow; thus from Perugia to Florence&mdash;being all the time
attached to one another&mdash;it took sixteen hours. Dr.
Conti, the prison doctor at Florence, said that Dr. Bogi&#263;
was ill, but as he declined to give him a certificate the
journey was resumed. From Florence to Leghorn he
was bound so tightly that his wrists were very much
swollen. From Leghorn in the <small>s.s.</small> <i>Derna</i> he was shipped
to Sardinia, where he had experience of several prisons,
including that of Terranuova-Pausania, where water
flows down the walls and vermin are everywhere. He
received 2.75 lire a day with which to buy his food, and
although he is a doctor they refused to let him read any
medical books. When I asked him of what he had been
guilty, he began by recounting his war work. Over
6000 Italian prisoners were at Knin, and he was there
as military doctor for more than two years. These
Italians were employed on the railway line and&mdash;as is
clear from the letters they wrote to him after their release&mdash;letters
some of which I read&mdash;they had very friendly
recollections of the doctor. Once in the summer of
1918 a group of Italians arrived who had been, in the
doctor's words, "bestially maltreated at Zala-Egerseg
by the Magyars." Dozens died on the way to Knin,
others while they were being got out of the station, others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
on the way to the hospital. They were nothing but
skeletons, dressed almost exclusively in paper clothes.
General Wucherer happened to be at Knin and to him
the doctor reported that the Italians had been treated in
an absolutely criminal fashion. Wucherer, who was a
decent fellow, ordered the doctor to dictate the whole
affair and said that if nothing else could be done he would
go direct to His Majesty. Then standing up he struck the
table, in the presence of his staff, of Dr. Grgin of Split
and of the railway commandant Captain Bergmann, and
"Wir sind doch die gr&ouml;ssten Schuften!" he exclaimed
("After all, it is we who are the biggest scoundrels!")....
When the Yugoslavs overthrew the Austrian Government
at Knin, the doctor, a kindly-looking, little, bald
man, made a speech to the prisoners from the balcony
of the town hall. He armed two of the Italians and ten
French prisoners, whom he told off to guard the magazine.
The two Italians (Cirillo Tomba and Mario Favelli)
vanished after a couple of days; the French remained
for a week, and when a French destroyer arrived at Split
they were taken there, not as prisoners but as soldiers,
bearing arms. Dr. Bogi&#263; was a member of the National
Committee at Knin, and as such he wrote to a colleague
at Drni&#353; to ask him whether the Italian troops were
coming up from &#352;ibenik. This letter was his undoing.
The reason he wrote it was because the population at
Knin was extremely agitated by the prospective occupation
and begged him to ascertain the latest news. He
should have remembered, no doubt, that the Italians
regarded this as enemy country and that to make inquiries
with regard to the movement of troops was a crime. An
officer came and asked him, in the General's name, if he
would kindly take part in a conference; on reaching the
place which was indicated he found himself surrounded
by carabinieri. Their captain, a certain Albano, said
that he and two or three others must go to &#352;ibenik to
undergo a short interrogatory, and that as he would return
in two days at the latest it was unnecessary for him to
take any money, clothes or linen. As a matter of fact
the doctor had, on the previous day, been warned from
Split that the Italians meant to intern him; but he laughed&mdash;he
had done so much for them and he felt so innocent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that it seemed absurd to run away. He could have
gone, because he had a written permit issued to him on
January 10 by the 144th Italian infantry regiment at
Knin, which stated that he and his wife might go, whenever
they wished, to Split.</p>


<p class="section">SEVEN HUNDRED OTHERS</p>

<p>During the winter and spring over seven hundred
persons, chiefly belonging to the clerical, the legal and
the medical professions, had been deported from Dalmatia.
The leader of the Italian party at Zadar told
me that two of them had written him from Nocera Umbra,
saying that this, their place of interment, was a health
resort and that they were getting fat. He scouted the
idea that they were under any sort of compulsion when
they wrote or that they were pulling his leg. One must
anyhow congratulate them in not being taken to Sardinia,
as were the vast majority. Those who managed to return
from that island&mdash;among them Dr. Macchiedo of Zadar,
through the intervention of Bissolati, on account of Mrs.
Macchiedo being at death's door&mdash;said that they found
in Sardinia what they had expected of a penal establishment.
Many priests were deported, on account of
crimes which varied in enormity. A very frequent
cause was that they refused to preach in Italian to a
congregation which only understood Serbo-Croat. One
must say that the Italians exhibited no religious partiality,
for they treated the Roman Catholic Church just the
same as the Orthodox. Some of the persecutions were
so fatuous that one could only suppose they must be
due to a misunderstanding. To mention only one which
came under my observation at Skradin, not far from
&#352;ibenik, where the Orthodox priest in his sumptuous
vestments had led his congregation out of the old town
in order to perform an annual ceremony in connection
with the fertility of the fields. In what way was the
Italian cause assisted when carabinieri broke up that
procession and refused even to allow the people to walk
back on the road, so that all of them, including the priest
and the other church officials with the sacred emblems,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
were forced to go back to Skradin as best they could by
wading through the marshes?</p>


<p class="section">A GLIMPSE OF THE OFFICIAL ROBBERIES</p>

<p>An allusion has been made to the Italian financial
methods. More than one Italian officer, including
Admiral Millo, spoke to me about the Austrian currency,
which seemed to them one of the gravest problems. In
Yugoslavia these notes were only legal tender if they had
the Government stamp, and the Italians resolved that
in the territories which they occupied the notes must
have no stamp upon them. So far, so good. But when
some poor peasant came across the line of demarcation
from Croatia or else landed somewhere in a boat the
Italians were not making good propaganda for themselves
when they seized the notes, tore them up and
refused to give their victim a receipt. One poor fellow
whom I know of came with his mother along that
wonderful road which the Austrians built over the
mountains and down to Obrovac. He had some serious
affection of the eyes and was compelled to go to Zadar
to consult an oculist. He took with him practically
all his fortune, as he and his mother did not know what
otherwise to do with it. They had never yet made use
of a bank. Well, the Italians tore up the notes and told
him testily to go about his business. The same thing
happened to the following persons:</p>

<p>These were the complaints over a period of a month,
which were received by the Provincial (Yugoslav)
Government at Split. One has to take their word for it
that the list is not fictitious. I did not investigate any
of the cases; the Italian officers to whom I showed the
list said that they were persuaded I would find that in
every case the person culpable was an officious, ignorant
N.C.O. The list is, of course, no more than a fragment.
At Starigrad, on the island of Hvar, I was told that from
the people, who were searched both on landing and on
leaving, 40,000 crowns had been confiscated, and at first
they had been told that the money should be stamped.
A merchant whom I happened to meet during the few
hours I was at Metkovi&#263; told me that he had gone to the
island of Kor&#269;ula to his brother and, on landing, had been
relieved of 34,000 crowns.</p>



<p class="section">AND HARSHNESS AND BRIBERY</p>

<p>In Asia Minor we have another disastrous example of
the Allied policy of allowing a disputed zone to be occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<i>ad interim</i> solely by the troops of one interested country.
The chronic state of war which followed the landing of
the Greeks at Smyrna, the atrocities, the charges and the
counter-charges, were investigated by an Inter-Allied
Commission of Inquiry; and their report, which was
issued early in 1920 and was signed by an American
Admiral and French, Italian and British Generals, laid
the responsibility at the door of the Greek Higher Command.
The Commission considered that an inter-Allied
occupation was necessary, because the Greeks, instead of
maintaining order, had given their position all the characteristics
of a permanent occupation, the Turkish
authorities being powerless. They also considered that
order should be maintained by inter-Allied troops other
than Greek.... No such Commission visited Dalmatia,
chiefly because the Yugoslavs, in spite of endless provocations,
displayed greater self-control than the Turks.
But an Inter-Allied Inquiry would have reported that
the Italian r&eacute;gime had not the marks of a permanent
occupation simply because such methods could never be
permanent: everywhere in the occupied territory it was
forbidden, under severe penalties, to have any Serbo-Croat
newspaper. On one island I found about fifteen
gentlemen gathered round a table in a sort of dungeon,
reading the newspapers which had been smuggled into
their possession. This they had been doing for more
than six months. Every letter was censored, all telegraphic
and telephonic communication between the
occupied territory and the outside world was prohibited.
All flags, of course, except that of Italy, were vetoed.
Admiral Millo told us that this prohibition did not extend
to the flags of France, Great Britain and the United
States; considering that it is on record when and where
the flags of these nations were, if flown by civilians,
ordered to be taken down at Rieka, despite the presence
of Allied contingents, it seems scarcely worth saying that,
as we were often told, the Admiral's permission, which
was in accordance with the Armistice, was disregarded
by his subordinates. Another thing that was very
rigorously forbidden, especially on the islands, was for
any Yugoslav to go down to the harbour, if a boat came
in, and carry on a conversation with somebody on board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
It would be tedious to enter into all the questionable
and tyrannical Italian methods, such as the requisitioning
of Yugoslav clubs, schools, etc., sometimes leaving
them empty because they found they did not want them,
the requisitioning of private houses, with no consideration
for their owners, the wholesale cutting-down of
forests, the closing of law-courts, the demand that other
courts should pronounce no judgment before first submitting
it to them. But, above all, what the Yugoslav
Government at Split complained of were the methods
they employed in the gratuitous or semi-gratuitous
distribution of food, clothing and money:</p>

<p>The section of propaganda of the Government of
Dalmatia, whose object is the rapid diffusion of Italianity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in this noble region which gives at last to Italy the
complete dominion over the most bitter Adriatic, has set
before itself a vast programme of truly Italian action
... it is therefore necessary to give
these latter certain advantages ... it has
been suggested that Italian schools be favoured ...
that offices be opened for the gratuitous
or semi-gratuitous distribution of food, that presents be
given to the indigent population, that f&ecirc;tes and spectacles
be organized.</p>

<p class="right">[Signature illegible.]</p>
</div>

<p>These two documents give some indication of the
plan of campaign. One might mention, by the bye,
that during this period there was a great shortage of
food-stuffs in Italy; large quantities were being sent
from the United States. The Yugoslav Government
at Split complained of the disastrous social and moral
results of these proceedings. It gave rise to many
abuses and to a clandestine trade. On the young it had,
for example, at Split a most unhealthy influence; all
they had to do was to go on board the <i>Puglia</i>, the Italian
flagship, whether their parents allowed them or not, and
there they were given both provisions and cash. As
elsewhere in the world there are at Split a number of
idlers and scamps, who seized this opportunity; another
class of person, who had erstwhile been regarded as
Austrian spies, did not hesitate a moment to proclaim
that they were the most ardent Italian patriots. All
these people were ready enough to give their signatures
to anything in return for the Italian bounty, and to
endeavour to persuade others to do so; in that way the
Italians collected 6000 signatures, whereas the Italianists
of Split were, at the outside, 1800; at Trogir, where the
Italianists numbered 80 to 100, they collected more than
1000 signatures.</p>


<p class="section">THE ITALIANS IN DALMATIA BEFORE AND DURING
THE WAR</p>

<p>To grasp the conditions at Split we must go back to
the years just before the War. From the reports of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Austrian Intelligence Officer, Captain Bukvich, we shall
see what was the attitude of the Slavs and the Italianists
respectively towards the Government, and hence towards
each other. It may be that the very loyal, some would
call it cringing, attitude of the Italianists was forced
upon them by the great inferiority of their numbers.
What they were aiming at, with very few exceptions,
were the benefits of the moment, rather than those others
of which here and there an isolated Italianist would dream,
when between the smoke of his cigarette he saw the
Italian tricolour flying over Dalmatia. If this lonely
dreamer had gone to Italy before the War with the purpose
of awakening in people an interest in what some day might
happen, he would have found that most of the Italians
had never heard of Dalmatia. But among those who
had heard were the officials of the "Liga Nazionale,"
which assisted the Dalmatian Italians to support those
famous schools. In a report (Information No. 668)
which Padouch, the successor of Bukvich as Intelligence
Officer, sent from Split on September 25, 1915, to the
Headquarters at Mostar, we are told that "an Italian of
this place, with whom I confidentially spoke on the subject
before the outbreak of the War, openly and candidly
told me that in their Liga school one-third of the children,
at the most, have parents whose nationality has always
been Italian. The others are children of the people,
of that class which on account of its humble social position
has lost its national consciousness. He told me that
the parents received subsidies and the children clothes,
school-books, etc., gratuitously."</p>

<p>The reports of Captain Bukvich were sent to his
superiors at Mostar. No doubt a great many documents
were destroyed just before the Austrian collapse, as the
Government had ordered to be done&mdash;three boxes, presumably
containing copies, are known to have been committed
to the flames at Split, while at Zadar there was a
wholesale destruction on October 31. Yet a fair number
of interesting papers survived, principally at Mostar,
Castelnuovo, Metkovi&#263; and Dubrovnik. In 1913 Captain
Bukvich sent many reports to the effect that Split was
completely anti-Austrian and that the Italian party were
the only loyal people. On September 16 he said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the inhabitants believe in the coming of a great Serbia,
and he substantiates this with numerous instances.
"The students over thirteen years of age," he says, "are
all Serbophil, and most of the masters, professors and State
clerks.... The chief paper in Split is Serbophil and has
been confiscated twenty-seven times between October
1912 and September 1913." He reported on August 19,
1913 (Information No. 211), to the General Staff of the
Imperial and Royal 16th Corps at Dubrovnik with reference
to the Francis Joseph celebrations of the previous
day: "... only the public buildings and a few other
houses were beflagged. One must notice the satisfactory
conduct and the finely decorated houses of the autonomous
Italian party." On February 27, 1914 (Information
No. 62), he narrates that a big dinner was given at the
bishop's palace to celebrate the centenary of the incorporation
of Dalmatia into the Habsburg monarchy; all
the chief citizens were invited to this dinner, but the
Croat deputies, Dr. Trumbi&#263;, Dr. Smodlaka and other
Croats declined with thanks. Dr. Salvi, however, of the
autonomous Italian party, put in an appearance. On
July 31 (Information No. 267) he refers to the mobilized
men who marched through the town and were put on
board ship. "The attitude," he says, "of the Slav
<i>intelligentsia</i> was quite passive. The Italian band waited
for the troops, a procession was improvised, great ovations
took place, and enthusiasm was shown by the Autonomous
party, who called: 'Hoch Austria! Hoch the Emperor!
Hoch the War! Down with Serbia! Down with the
Serbian municipality!'" A certain Demeter, an Austrian
naval lieutenant, was a spectator of these scenes. He
made some notes for the typist, afterwards embodied in a
report to the Military Command at Mostar and marked
"Secret No. 147." He relates, with unconcealed fury,
how the Slavs not merely displayed no raptures when the
War proclamation was read, but walked away in the
midst of the recital and refrained from following the band,
which later on paraded the town. Only the Italians, he
said, exhibited the proper feeling. They did more than
that; for with the same date, July 31, one finds an interesting
letter from the "Societ&agrave; del Tiro al Bersaglio" of
Split, which called itself a shooting club, but was not in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
possession of arms; it was, as a matter of fact, a gymnastic
society with a political object. The secretary,
Luigi Puisina, wrote on the 31st to the authorities, to
say that they had determined to offer themselves in uniform
for any service of a military nature ("per quei
qualsiasi servizi di carattere militare"). Bukvich reported
on August 3 (Information No. 268) that for the
present these gymnasts will be used as special constables,
and he adds, to one's astonishment, that this has caused
the Slav <i>intelligentsia</i> to be still more profoundly depressed.
Nothing could elude the eagle eye of Bukvich: on December
17, 1914, he noted that the small boys in the streets
were winking and smiling at each other in consequence of
the news that the Austrians had been driven out of Belgrade.</p>

<p>When Italy entered the War a handful of Dalmatian
Italians&mdash;I believe six from Zadar and two from Split&mdash;went
to serve in the Italian army. Five others, four of
them from Zadar, were interned at Graz; with these
exceptions the Italians and Italianists were very much
more faithful to the Austrian Empire than were the
Croats, hundreds of whom were hanged or shot or lodged
in fortresses. The Italians, however, persist in charging
the Croats with unbounded fidelity; in fact, it is one of
their most powerful arguments. They themselves in
Split continued to do what the Austrians expected of
them: those who were of military age became units of the
army, while the rest of them, with one exception, were not
incommoded. The President of their club, the "Cabinetto
di Lettura," that Dr. Salvi of whom we have heard, was
not only most assiduous in addressing letters of devotion
and fidelity to the Emperor, in promoting all kinds of
patriotic Austrian manifestations, but as the particular
friend of Mr. Tszilvas, the Austrian sub-prefect, he was
wont to go down with him to the harbour and watch the
embarkation, in chains, of the Slav <i>intelligentsia</i>. The
only Italian who suffered this fate was a Mr. Tocigl, with
whom Dr. Salvi had had a personal difference.</p>


<p class="section">CONSEQUENT SUSPICION OF THIS MINORITY</p>

<p>One cannot therefore be surprised if the Slavs, on the
collapse of Austria, regarded the Italian party, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
especially Dr. Salvi, with some suspicion. Since they
had always placed themselves at Austria's disposal, it
would be most natural if they attempted by a <i>coup
d'&eacute;tat</i> to save the Empire. Yet this was the moment
when they joined the Slavs and helped to turn the
Austrians out. There was no notion then that the Italian
army would succeed the Austrian; and it was not until
Christmas that this army tried to enter Split. When
they proposed to come ashore they were prevented by
the French, Americans and British; thereupon they
threatened to come overland&mdash;although the town was not
included in the London Treaty&mdash;but again they were prevented.
In February, on the occasion of a conference
between the four Admirals, there was a demonstration
against Italy, the commandant of the <i>Puglia</i> being struck
and Admiral Rombo's chief of staff insulted. There was
a widespread feeling of resentment at the way in which
the <i>Puglia</i> was, as we have seen, availing herself of the
baser elements in the town for the furtherance of her propaganda;
but what put the match to the bonfire was the
omission of certain Italians in uniform to salute the Serbian
National Anthem. The Admirals held an inquiry, found
that "officers belonging to an Allied nation have been
molested." They announced that they would not tolerate
a repetition of such acts, and that inter-Allied patrols,
acting with Serbian troops and the local police force,
would take measures to prevent them. On March 8,
however, there was a renewal of the troubles; and again
the Admirals made an inquiry. The Italian member
of the Commission added to his signature that he disapproved
of the findings and that he would present a
special report.</p>


<p class="section">ALLIED CENSURE OF THE ITALIAN NAVY</p>

<p>"By general conviction," says the Admirals' summing
up, "there exist at Split two political parties which are in
sharp contradiction as to the future status of Dalmatia.
The presence of Allied ships, and especially the Italian
ones, has increased this contradiction rather than
diminished it. On the day when disorders broke out
at Split a few Italian sailors had made a small demonstration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a little before the incidents. Certain movements
and words on the part of youths, sympathizers with
Yugoslavia, offended the Italian sailors. They were bold
enough to arrest two of these youths.... This procedure
of arresting them naturally and inevitably moved the
great majority of the bystanders and was the actual
cause of outrages. This act was approved by the Italian
Naval Authorities, who accordingly are to be considered
responsible for these disorders.... Several civilians
and Serbian soldiers were wounded." The report adds
that some Italian sailors were armed with knives and revolvers,
contrary to the regulations of the Italian Naval
Authorities, and concludes with these words: "By arresting
some citizens the Italian sailors have committed an
illegal act, which they carried out according to instructions
that were given them by the Italian Naval Authorities.
Accordingly the Commission considers these
authorities responsible for the injuries inflicted on the
Serbian soldiers."</p>


<p class="section">NEVERTHELESS THE TYRANNY CONTINUES</p>

<p>But in many parts of Dalmatia and the islands the
Italians had no fear of such a Commission. Let us see
what they had been doing in the neighbourhood of Zadar,
the old capital. Apart from the usual prohibitions with
respect to newspapers and so forth, the municipalities
were dissolved and an Italian commissary installed. Their
first task was to introduce the Italian language and make
it obligatory, although the commissary's own employees
would often be not more acquainted with it than with
Hindustani. Eighty-five per cent. of the civil servants
in the occupied territory were Yugoslavs; during March
and April 1919 they were deprived of their salaries because
they had declined, in accordance with the existing laws
and particularly in accordance with the terms of the
Armistice, to make a request in Italian to the Provisional
Government that they should be confirmed in their posts.
This outrageous order, which left hundreds of families
without the means of subsistence, was not merely illegal&mdash;let
alone inhumane&mdash;but was in contradiction with an
earlier order issued by Admiral Millo, which was placarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
throughout the territory and which confirmed in their
posts all the civil employees. However, the Italians were
unsuccessful in their efforts to obtain these signatures,
though they did not abandon their watchword: "Either
Italy or starvation!" They never ceased to persecute
the peasants of the surrounding country and islands.
Commands, menaces, blows inflicted by carabinieri and
officers, houses searched night after night, and so on....
In the second half of February it was intended to conduct
a number of peasants, accompanied by Italian flags, to
Zadar, so that they might thank the Admiral, who chanced
to be there, for the benefits which Italy had bestowed
upon them. An officer who in this branch achieved
particular distinction was Lieutenant de Sanctis, the
Commandant of Preko, a village opposite Zadar. Bread
and Italian promises were dangled before these poverty-stricken
fisherfolk and peasants; they refused to take
part in the ridiculous demonstration, and in order to
avoid being made to go they concealed themselves and
even went to the length of sinking their boats. In the
possession of a peasant at Preko, &#352;ime &#352;ari&#263; Mazi&#263;, were
found some banknotes with a Yugoslav stamp on them
and a very small French flag; for these transgressions
de Sanctis ordered first that he should receive a box on
the ears, after which he was bound, thrown into prison,
and there flogged by carabinieri who, as two doctors
afterwards certified, inflicted serious injuries upon his
hands, which they beat with chains. For the same
reasons and at the same place a peasant called Mate
Lon&#269;ar was imprisoned and wounded with a bayonet.
On March 2 at Preko the Italians, enraged because the
people had not come to their demonstration, dispersed
with sticks all those who were assembled in front of the
church, and prevented the Mass from being celebrated.
On March 29 the aforementioned Lon&#269;ar was condemned
to three years' imprisonment because 11,780 crowns,
unstamped notes, had been found on him; the notes, of
course, were confiscated. Such notes, by the way, were
given or received in payment by Italian merchants at a
discount of 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. Even
the military used these forbidden notes, and compelled
the peasants at the market to accept them. In the night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of March 15-16 six of the leading Yugoslavs of Zadar,
who had not ceased to advise the people to bear their
present misfortunes in patience, were suddenly arrested
and deported to Italy; they included Mr. Joseph de
Ton&#269;i&#263;, President of the Yugoslav Club and formerly
the Deputy-Governor of Dalmatia; he was a man seventy-two
years of age and in precarious health. During this
same night forty persons were deported from Knin, three
from Drni&#353;, three from Obrovac, four from Skradin, nine
from &#352;ibenik and four from Benkovac.... On the
populous island of Olib (Ulbo) the abuses connected with
the distribution of food were exceptionally flagrant;
here the Italian officers compelled everyone to stand still,
bare-headed, when they passed; they would not allow
anyone to leave the island, and forbade the peasants to
speak Croatian! On the opposite island of Silba (Selve)
the schoolmaster, Matulina, and the priest, an old man of
seventy-five, called Lovrovi&#263;, were imprisoned. The latter
had told his parishioners, in the course of a sermon, to
behave well during Lent and keep away from the Italian
sailors. He was thereupon shipped to Zadar and thrust
into a moist and dirty dungeon, where for two days and
nights he was at the mercy of six criminals.... After
having seen at Zadar a number of persons belonging to
each party, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Boxich.
It was indeed a pleasure, because this thin, highly-strung
Italianized Slav, the former chief of the Radical Italian
party, was full of the most fraternal sentiments towards
the Slavs. If, he said, their peasants lacked education,
one ought to assist them; not to do so was a sin against
humanity. It had been the desire, he said, of his party,
both before and during the War, to work openly against
the Austrian Government, unlike the Moderate Italian
party, of Ziliotto, which feigned to be very pro-Austrian.
While Ziliotto was receiving high Austrian decorations,
he was an object of persecution, and was obliged to go
away and live for two and a half years in Rome. Ziliotto,
he said, was Zadar's evil spirit, seeing that he had thoroughly
deceived and betrayed Italy&mdash;so many of those who now
called themselves good Italians had been very good
Austrians, and would as readily have turned into good
Americans or Frenchmen. So petty and local was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Ziliotto's party, with no idea of the world or of freedom.
In fact, I thought that if a Yugoslav had listened to the
doctor's eloquence he would have overlooked a recent
lapse or two, when Boxich, in order to prove to Admiral
Millo that he was a much better Italian than Ziliotto, was
alleged by the Yugoslavs to have committed various dark
deeds in connection with a hunt for hidden arms. The
Admiral also had told me that he was not pleased with
Dr. Boxich. "At present," said the doctor to me, "I
am isolated, and I am proud of it. This is not the time
to found a party of ideas; the atmosphere is too morbid,
too passionate. This is the time," he said, "for an
honourable man to remain isolated and to stay at home." ...
Several weeks after this at Sarajevo, I read in a
Zagreb newspaper, the <i>Rije&#263; S.H.S.</i>, that Dr. Boxich,
on account of having&mdash;exceptionally, the paper said&mdash;spoken
the truth to a passing foreigner, had been deported
to Italy.</p>


<p class="section">A VISIT TO SOME OF THE ISLANDS</p>

<p>It was impossible to be at Split without meeting
people who had fled from the occupied islands. It was
also, in consequence of what they told one, impossible
to set out with an unprejudiced mind. But, after all,
we have our preconceived ideas on Heaven and Hell, and
that will be no reason for us not to go there. I had
become acquainted at Split with Captain Pommerol, of the
British Army, a Mauritian of imposing physique and, as
I was to see, of a lofty sense of justice. He had recently
been spending several months in Hungary on a mission
from the War Office. They had now dispatched him to
Dalmatia and Bosnia with a very comprehensive programme;
and, as I secured a little steamer, he came
with me to the islands. [We hesitated to embark on this
expedition, since the islanders whose national desires had
been choked for so many months would probably display
their sentiments in such a way as to bring down grave
penalties upon themselves. But the Yugoslavs, both on
the mainland and on the islands, were anxious that we
should go; they doubted whether Western Europe had
any knowledge of the Italian methods of administration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
And if the immediate result of our journey would be to
call down upon themselves&mdash;as indeed it did&mdash;a savage
wind, they were optimistic enough to feel that it would
eventually produce a whirlwind for their oppressors.] ...
The <small>s.s.</small> <i>Porer</i>, 130 tons, was flying at the stern the
temporary flag of white, blue, white in horizontal stripes
which had been invented for the ships of the former
Austro-Hungarian mercantile marine; on the second
mast they displayed the flag of one of the Allies, and the
<i>Porer</i> happened to be sailing under the red ensign. She
had a Dalmatian crew of eight, including the weather-beaten
old captain and the still older and equally benevolent
gentleman who combined the functions of cook and
steward. In addition to Serbo-Croat, they had among
them some knowledge of Italian, German and even
English. The scholar was the mate who, having had
his headquarters at Pola during the War, spoke Viennese-German.
His wife had died at Split after an illness of
several months, brought on by the idea that her husband
had been killed at Pola in an air-raid.</p>

<p>The large, rather waterless island of Bra&#263;, which is
nearest to the mainland, seems to be chiefly remarkable
on account of its chrysanthemums, from which an insect-powder
is produced; and the number of changes, no less
than twenty, that occurred in the ownership of the island
from the beginning of the Middle Ages down to the Congress
of Vienna. During that period it was sometimes
under the Byzantines, sometimes the Venetians, the Holy
Roman Empire, its own autonomous Government, the
Hungarians, the Bosnians, the French, the Russians (one
year, in 1806) and the Austrians. It was not occupied
by Italy after the end of this War, and Baron Sonnino did
not ask for it when he was negotiating, before the War,
with Austria.</p>


<p class="section">WHICH THE ITALIANS HAD TRIED TO OBTAIN BEFORE, BUT
NOT DURING, THE WAR</p>

<p>The Italian Government put forward the question of
the islands for the first time in April 11, 1915. There had
been no previous discussion, passionate or otherwise, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in the case of the Trentino and Triest. But now they
demanded various Dalmatian islands, the chief of which
were Hvar, Kor&#269;ula and Vis, with a total population (in
1910) of 57,954. The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador
reported (cf. Red Book, concerning April 14, p. 133)
that a conversation between Baron Sonnino and Prince
B&uuml;low with respect to these islands had been extremely
animated, and that Sonnino had pointed out that the
Navy and the whole country expected of him that he
would alter Italy's unfavourable position on the Adriatic,
where from Venice to Taranto she had not one serviceable
harbour, that is to say serviceable war-harbour. And
Sonnino added that he thought this was an opportune
moment in which to rectify that state of things. On
April 28 the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, besides
drawing the Italians' attention to the nationality of the
islanders&mdash;1&middot;62 per cent. calling themselves Italian&mdash;pointed
out that not only would there no longer be any
question of a strategic equilibrium in the Adriatic if
Austria were to lose these islands, but that the adjacent
coast would always be threatened. On May 4, the
Ambassador asked whether an arrangement with Italy
would be impossible if the Austrians agreed to every one
of Italy's other conditions, showing thereby what the
value of these islands was in Austrian eyes. When
Sonnino did not reply to this question, the Ambassador
understood that Italy's participation in the War had been
determined. But on May 10, the Austrian Government
made up its mind to give up Pelagosa "on account of its
proximity to the Italian coast." As a matter of fact it
lies 42 miles from Vis and 33 miles from the nearest point
in Apulia. As a strategic base this group of rocks would
have no value, since the water is too deep for the construction
of a harbour, and the sirocco rages with such
ferocity that it flings the foam over the top of the lighthouse,
which is 360 feet in height. This inhospitable place,
with its population of 13 human beings, some sheep and
goats, was inhabited in prehistoric days; when the excavations
were being made for the lighthouse a variety
of implements from the Stone Age were discovered, including
a stone arrow that was found between the ribs
of a skeleton.... But the Austrian Ambassador let it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
be known at the same time that he would be prepared
to make a further friendly examination of the Italian
demands with reference to the other islands. His Government
also on May 15 (Red Book, No. 185, p. 181) announced
that they were quite disposed to reopen the
discussion. However, on the 23rd of the month, Italy
came into the War. The Italians had been explaining that
if only Austria would give up these islands&mdash;which was
as if you were to invite a person whose designs you suspected
to come and camp in the hall of your house&mdash;then,
said the Italians, there would be an excellent prospect of
permanently amicable relations between the two States.</p>


<p class="section">OUR WELCOME TO JEL&#352;A</p>

<p>As soon as the War was over, Italy disembarked on
the islands which she had obtained by the Treaty of
London. Something has been said on previous pages
of the way in which she introduced herself and made
herself at home. As we were sailing towards the pretty
town of Jel&#353;a (Gelsa) on the island of Hvar, we left
Vrbo&#353;ka on our right. The Bishop of Split had told me of
a grievance which the Italian troops at that place had
lodged with his brother, the mayor. Some of them had
visited, for the f&ecirc;tes of carnival, both the Yugoslav Club,
where they found many persons who could speak Italian,
and the Italian Club, where they were annoyed to find
that it was spoken by very few. As we came into the
little port of Jel&#353;a, with the green shutters of its white
houses harmonizing with the foliage of the cypresses and
oleanders, we could see a crowd of people running round&mdash;and
carabinieri running with them&mdash;to that part of
the harbour where we were unexpectedly going to stop.
There was some confusion, the carabinieri pushing the
people back, evidently to prevent them shaking hands
with us; and one small boy who did not hear or did not
understand what they were shouting received a terrific
blow in the back from the fist of a furious Italian. Some
cries were raised in honour of Yugoslavia, Wilson, France
and England, which may have been imprudent; but
when a place in which there is not one single Italian has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
been held down for months, has been forbidden to show
the slightest joy on account of the birth of Yugoslavia,
has been savagely punished for having a copy of a Yugoslav
newspaper, has repeatedly been cursed and cuffed and
ordered, at the bayonet's point, to execute some wish of the
carabinieri&mdash;one cannot be astonished if in the presence of
some non-Italian foreigners they could no longer repress
their feelings. Some of the people had brought flowers
with them, and as Pommerol and I plunged into the whirlpool
and made our way towards the Italian commander's
office, we had many flowers either thrust into our hands
while the carabinieri were looking the other way or else
we had them thrown at us, in which case some of them
would usually descend upon the shoulders or the three-cornered
hats of the carabinieri. Whenever anybody
uttered one of the forbidden exclamations one or more of
the carabinieri would fling themselves into the crowd and
attempt, with the help of vigorous kicking, to reach the
culprit. Thus, in the midst of a series of scrimmages, we
got to the captain's quarters. We found him a very pleasant
young man, keenly conscious of the difficulties of his
position; as we afterwards heard, he was such an improvement
on his predecessor that the carabinieri were convinced
he was a Yugoslav and had been heard to mutter
threats against his life. He had apologized to the inhabitants,
and had dismissed one of his men who had hauled
down a Yugoslav flag and blown his nose on it. For these
men an extenuating circumstance was that they had
been very drunk on the night before our arrival, as they
had heard&mdash;it was in the first half of June 1919&mdash;that the
islands had been definitely given to Italy, and this they
had been celebrating. We knew that after an American
and an Englishman had visited Jel&#353;a, in the time of the
other commandant, some of the people were interned;
the young captain assured us that he would do no such
thing. And one could see that he would never imitate
the brutality of his predecessor, who had caused a frail
old man of sixty-six, Professor Zari&#263;, to be pulled out
of his bed in the middle of a winter's night and taken
across the hills on a donkey to Starigrad, afterwards on a
destroyer to Split, from where&mdash;but for the intervention
of the American Admiral&mdash;he would have been deported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to Italy; and all on account of his having written, in
English and French, a scientific ethnographical treatise on
the islands.</p>


<p class="section">PROCEEDINGS AT STARIGRAD</p>

<p>At Starigrad on our arrival the harbour and its precincts
looked like the scene of an opera, with an opening
chorus of carabinieri. They were posted at various
tactical points and no one else was visible. One of them
advanced, however, and conducted us at our request to
the office of the Commandant, a major who must have
played a very modest part in the War, as I believe he only
had three rows of ribbons.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> He gave us some vermouth
and informed us that the population was very quiet, very
happy. When I said that I would like to see the mayor
he sent an orderly, and in less than one minute his worship
stood before us. He immediately confirmed what the
major had said with regard to the population. In fact
the picture which he drew brought back to memory the
comment of the Queen of Roumania who, when an
American lady at a reception in Belgrade told her that
she lived at a place called Knoxville or Coxville in the
States, replied "How nice!" The good Italians, quoth
the mayor, were distributing supplies among the natives,
and with the exception of the Croat <i>intelligentsia</i> they all
wished for union with Italy. I asked him if he did not
think that, looking at it from the economic point of view,
there would be some difficulties when the island's exports&mdash;wine
and oil and fish&mdash;would have to compete with the
products of Italy. But he said that one must think of
the other benefits&mdash;no longer would the island have to
bear the hated Austrian. It was all the fault of Austria,
he continued, that after 1885 the Starigrad municipality
had been Croat; since then the Italians had lost their
school and their orchestra. But now it would all be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>changed. He was clearly a product of the new dispensation;
and he told me that as the ex-mayor was an
Austrian of course he had to be discharged. Nothing else
did this gentleman tell me, which was a pity, as in a
message, presumably sent by him, to an Italian newspaper,
<i>La Dalmazia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of Zadar, it was stated that in this
conversation I had displayed a supreme ignorance of local
questions.... Then we all stood up and the major said
that he would accompany us down to the boat. I told
him that I would join him there after I had seen some
Yugoslavs, and Pommerol was good enough to walk away
with him while I went round the ancient little town&mdash;it
even has some Cyclop&aelig;an walls&mdash;with certain Yugoslavs,
two lawyers and a doctor. One of the lawyers turned out
to be the ex-mayor, whose Austrianism had apparently
taken a less active form than that of his successor, for he
had only been an Austrian subject, while the actual mayor&mdash;Dr.
Tama&#353;kovi&#263;&mdash;had served, until the end of the War,
in the 22nd Austrian Regiment. With regard to the
events of 1885, they told me that this was the time when
the Croatian national consciousness awoke, so that an
insufficient number of people had remained either to support
an Italian school or yet an orchestra. And now the
number of Italian adherents was about 200 (out of 3600),
and might increase if ice-creams were handed round in
all the schools. One of my companions happened to live
in the house of Hektorovi&#263;, the sixteenth-century poet,
and we spent a few minutes in the perfectly delightful
garden with its palms and shady paths and bathing tank,
like that one in the Alcazar at Seville. Then we went
on to the harbour where a number of the people were
collected. Pommerol was in the middle of a group of
military and naval officers and civilians, these latter being
partly visitors from Istria and Zadar. Suddenly a woman,
standing near me, threw her head back and cried: "Viva
Italia!" when other people joined her she redoubled
her efforts. I should say that about thirty people were
gathered round the major, shouting for Italy, and he was
obviously gratified. But then a much larger number of
persons who had different sentiments began to shout for
Wilson, Yugoslavia and so forth. The carabinieri rushed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>among them, howling vengeance. A Mrs. Politeo, who
was holding a bouquet, was flung down by them and
trampled on. The lawyers and the doctor with whom
I had been walking were all three struck over the head
or on the shoulders with the butt end of muskets. (<i>La
Dalmazia</i> wrote that I had been filling their heads with
idle tales.) Children were screaming. I saw another
woman, hatless, being dragged off by a couple of carabinieri&mdash;and
a naval officer, who was disgusted, sternly
ordered them to let her go&mdash;and they obeyed reluctantly.
Four Dominican monks were next attacked&mdash;they had
not taken part in the demonstration; it was enough for
the carabinieri that they belonged to the Yugoslav party.
One of them, Father Rabadan&mdash;an elderly gentleman
with gold spectacles&mdash;was thrown down, struck until his
face was covered with blood, and then dragged off to
prison. The carabinieri were being helped by soldiers&mdash;one
of these I saw in the act of loading his rifle&mdash;and the
noise was tremendous. Here one would see a Yugoslav
trying to tell one of the warriors that he had done nothing;
then another ardito would go swooping on to his prey:
one or two of the officers looked awkward&mdash;one or two
actually looked exultant. As we steamed out of the
harbour four or five carabinieri and arditi were running
along the road parallel with us, others were climbing over
the stone walls&mdash;apparently it was a man-hunt. <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads '(&#34;There'">"There</ins>
are places in Dalmatia," Signor Luzzatti, an Italian ex-Premier,
had been saying in the <i>Temps</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> "where
Yugoslavs and Italians are mingled; but it is clear that
in those circumstances the oldest and serenest civilization
should prevail. Italy in her relations with other races
has continued the traditions of ancient Rome.... It is
their palpitating desire [<i>i.e.</i> that of Fiume, Sebenico, Zara,
Tra&ugrave;, Spalato, etc.] to live under the direct protection of
Italy." And on the next day a telegram was sent to
Split from the unoccupied island of Bra&#263;, giving the
names of twenty-one persons who were arrested, and the
name [Semeri] of an officer who had helped to beat Father
Rabadan and continued: "The carabinieri are still
looking for Yugoslavs. On the occasion of the arrestment
of the clerk Nikola Pavi&#269;i&#263;, the musket of an ardito went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>off and an eye was blown out to Mr. Pavi&#269;i&#263;. Great
terror prevails among the Yugoslav population." A later
message, to the newspaper <i>Jadran</i> at Split, said that
twenty-eight persons had been arrested and imprisoned
in two narrow cells, which were overlooked from the
neighbouring houses. There they were being maltreated,
and for the first day being given nothing to eat. Everyone
felt surprise that among the arrested was a certain
Mr. Vladimir Vrankovi&#263;, as he was one of those who had
betrayed their nationality. But after ten minutes this
clumsiness on the part of a carabiniere was rectified and,
by command of Major Penatta, he was released. All
those who could get away from Starigrad were taking
refuge in the villages. The message ended by asking
for the intervention of the Entente, as the people's life
was being made intolerable, and for the reason that they
would not trample under foot everything which they
regard as holy. But, according to <i>La Dalmazia</i>, the
indignant Italian population sent to the Paris Conference
a vibrating telegram, which begged for immediate annexation
to Italy, and protested against those who in an
unworthy and ugly manner had disturbed the place's
beautiful tranquillity.... The prisoners were court-martialled
at Zadar and condemned to terms that varied
from four to eight months&mdash;seven of the accused, including
Father Rabadan and two other Dominicans, receiving
the severest sentence.... I hope the indignant Italian
population dispatched, later on, a telegram of thanks to
the Paris Conference for having ordered Yugoslavia to
guarantee the position of the handful of Italians to be
left in Yugoslav territory, and even their special commercial
interests in Dalmatia; while the half million
Slovenes and Croats whom Italy proposed to annex were
not to be protected by an equivalent guarantee. It
would be ridiculous to bind with such conditions a Great,
Liberal Power.</p>

<p>After this it was no great surprise to hear, on reaching
Hvar, the capital of the island, that our further progress
was impeded. The pale Commandant of sinister aspect,
this time a naval officer, Lieut. Vincenzo Villa, showed us
a telegram from the Vice-Admiral at Kor&#269;ula, which said
that we were not to be allowed to speak to any of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
inhabitants. "To explore the islands there is some little
difficulty," said Burton in a lecture on the ruined cities,
which he visited when he was Consul at Triest. Early in
the morning our cook, who went ashore to see what he
could buy, was immediately arrested by the carabinieri,
who were keeping order very much like those "bravissimi
citadini" who in the autumn of 1870, when many of the
citizens of Rome were at loggerheads with the Vatican,
arrested and disarmed all those adherents of the Papacy
who showed their noses outside the Vatican's portals.
Our cook was afterwards released by the Commandant,
who allowed him to visit the market, escorted by carabinieri.
After that we returned to Split, and from there
to Zadar, in order to see Admiral Millo.</p>

<p>One would like to know what the Admiral would have
said if this interview had taken place a few months later
when, in alliance with Gabriele d'Annunzio, he was in
open, armed revolt against the Government of Italy.
The dark-bearded, stately Admiral, Senator of the
Kingdom, had not begun as yet to make that series of
buccaneering speeches, and he courteously told us, more
than once, that he could permit of nothing which would
outrage public order. He was much afraid that if we
went back to the islands we would be the cause of lamentable
scenes; in fact he could not let us go without an
order from his Government. "These islands," he said,
"are not yet ours; we are occupying them, as you know,
in the name of the Entente and the United States. You
have the right," he said, "to go there; but, unfortunately,
if you do, the population will give way, as they have done
already, to excesses." Since the last thing that we wished
was for the islanders to bring us flowers and cheer the
name of Wilson&mdash;in view of what these crimes entailed&mdash;we
suggested that a small number, four or five of each
party&mdash;those who desired to be with Yugoslavia and
those who preferred Italy&mdash;should in succession come
to us on board. Naturally we should be unable to do so
if we had to visit any inland place; and after a prolonged
argument the Admiral agreed to this plan. We
returned to Hvar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE AFFAIRS OF HVAR</p>

<p>The subordinate Admiral, from Kor&#269;ula, had come
across on a destroyer and was kind enough to tell us at
considerable length what were his views on local and
international affairs. He frankly appealed to us&mdash;and
his humorous blue eyes were radiating frankness&mdash;to
survey the whole matter in a broad, statesmanlike fashion.
But we were less ambitious; we desired merely to be the
mouthpiece of both parties. Those who first came on
board were the Italianists, and I hope I shall not be
considered unfair if I employ this word rather than
"Italians" for a body of men, most of whom are admittedly
devoid of any Italian blood and whose Italian
sympathies are of very recent growth. This class numbers
9 per cent. of the population of the town. Their chief
point seemed to be that the Church was opposed to them,
because there was no room for clericalism in Italy (!);
and the only other point worth mentioning was that
Austria was to blame for the phylloxera which had
played havoc with their vines. Among the Yugoslavs
who succeeded these gentlemen there was an elderly
priest, a canon, who related that some carabinieri&mdash;no
doubt in order to display to all men that Italy had shaken
herself free from clerical obscurantism&mdash;entered the
church while the bishop was officiating, and hoisted on the
roof an Italian flag. This canon, Dom Ivo Bojani&#263;,
could scarcely be blamed if the Italian innovations did
not appeal to him. He chanced to be looking out of his
window on a moonlit night and noticed that an agile
policeman was climbing up to his balcony for the purpose
of decorating it with an Italian flag. The old gentleman
protested, and was thereupon taken to the barracks,
where he remained for one day. The Yugoslavs told
us that the state of things was worse than in Africa&mdash;but
that was a figure of speech; the facts were that the
different societies and clubs had been closed, that all
persons going down to the harbour had been forbidden to
speak their own language to their friends on board ship,
that three Croat teachers had fled to escape being interned,
while an Italian soldier who did not know a word
of Croatian had been appointed in their place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">FOUR MEN OF KOMI&#381;A</p>

<p>When we departed from Hvar the Admiral sent his
destroyer to accompany us on our tour. She had on
board a Roman journalist, Signor Roberto Buonfiglio,
who was travelling in Dalmatia and the islands on behalf
of the clerical <i>Corriere d'Italia</i>. The situation at Vis,
the historic palm-shaded capital of the island of the same
name, has already been described. The Italian Commandant,
Sportiello, was a tactful and popular person;
moreover the Yugoslavs were on the best of terms with
Dr. Doimi, the head of one of the very rare Italian families.
At Komi&#382;a, the other little town on that island, the relations
between Yugoslavs and Italianists were not so
cordial. But the deputation which represented the latter
party comprised one man whom the Austrians had put in
gaol for several years for forgery; a father and son, of
whom the one had sold himself for the sake of rice, while
the other had also been imprisoned by the Austrians for
uttering false documents; the fourth and most innocent
member&mdash;his name happened to be Innocent Buliani&mdash;had
nothing to conceal except his fickleness, for in a
short period he had called himself an Austrian, a Yugoslav
and an Italian. None of these four was a native of the
place, whereas the Yugoslavs who came to see us were
natives who had risen to be the chief doctor, lawyer,
priest and merchant. One of the Italianists, Antonio
Spadoni, told us that the people were afraid of expressing
their real wishes for union with Italy. This hypothesis
might seem to demand some elucidation, but Signor
Spadoni insisted on passing on to the "Workers' Society,"
which the young Commandant had founded for the
purpose, according to Spadoni, of helping the people to
find work and of looking after their interests. We were
subsequently told by the Yugoslavs that the Commandant
himself called the members his "Rice Italians," for many
of them did not speak the language and did not even
sympathize with Italy. But on joining they had committed
themselves to something that was printed at the
top of the paper, which part had been turned over. It
really doesn't sound very worthy of a Great Power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
When some of the members, discovering to what they
were committed, sent in their resignation, it was refused.
At Komi&#382;a all the municipal officers had been discharged
by the Italians, the reading-rooms and places of amusement
had been closed, and the Food Administrator at
Split was forbidden to send any food, lest he should interfere
with the Italians' object in distributing rice, etc.
Once he was permitted to forward some American flour,
and the people had to pay forty crowns of duty on each
hundredweight.</p>


<p class="section">THE WOMEN OF BI&#352;EVO</p>

<p>From Komi&#382;a, the next morning, we steamed over on
the destroyer to the wonderful blue grotto of Bi&#353;evo (or
Busi), which surpasses Capri. An Austrian Archduke,
we were told, had once waited a week at Komi&#382;a, but had
been compelled to leave without seeing the cave. We
were more fortunate&mdash;the wind, the water and the sun
were kind to us; we entered in a rowing-boat the little
pearl-grey Gothic chapel which Nature has constructed
underneath a hill, and as we gazed into the blue-green
waters, through which from the rocks below a fountain
of most brilliant blue was rising, every time an oar was
dipped the waters painted it a silvery white. The population
of Bi&#353;evo consists of about 150 people, who mostly
live around the little church of Saint Sylvester, two hundred
feet above the sea. They occupy themselves with sheep
and fruit and bees and fish, and with the vines that are
even more famous than those of Vis. A good part of
the population had assembled on a grassy platform high
above the entrance to the cave, and as we climbed out of
the rowing-boat on to the destroyer a much larger rowing-boat
came round a promontory. Sixteen women formed
the crew. They sang their national Croatian songs, and
when they approached us some of them stood up and,
while the wind played with their straw-coloured and
golden hair, they laughingly threw flowers at us. As we
left Bi&#353;evo the men and women high above us and the
women in the boat were waving their hands; some of
them were singing, others were shouting a farewell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Here and there on the sunlit waters, rising and falling,
were the flowers which had woven on the sea a gorgeous
carpet. "Well," said the lieutenant-commander, "I
admit that this is a Yugoslav island."</p>

<p>I forget whether Signor Buonfiglio made any remark,
but a few hours later at Velaluka he was most incensed.
As our boat&mdash;we had returned to the old <i>Porer</i> at
Komi&#382;a&mdash;sailed into the harbour a huge Yugoslav flag
was flying from the summit of a hill, with French, British
and American flags around it. The destroyer had arrived
before us and the burly journalist was striding up and
down the quay. "I protest," he exclaimed, as he saw
us, "and not as a journalist but as an Italian citizen!
I protest!" Between us and the front row of houses,
which included the town-major's office, there was a large
empty space&mdash;the inhabitants could be descried up the
side-streets and behind the windows. De Michaelis,
the town-major, was evidently a superior young man;
as he poured out the champagne he told us with perfect
frankness that the educated people at Velaluka were
Yugoslavs. Suddenly there was a terrific noise just
underneath us. We hurried downstairs and found that
the soldiers in their excitement had fired off a machine
gun into the wall. Half an hour later the firing could be
heard from the top of the hill, but we never ascertained
whether anyone was wounded. In this place the
Italianist party sent to us an ex-publican who had now
joined the police, a small trader and a municipal clerk
who had recently been imported from Zadar. The
Yugoslavs were a large landowner, a doctor and a priest,
who told us that the people for the most part were refusing
to accept gratuitous food from the Italians.</p>


<p class="section">ON THE WAY TO BLATO</p>

<p>We were anxious to visit Blato, an inland village of
8000 inhabitants. De Michaelis regretted very much that
he had no carriage, but a Yugoslav had a quaint little
car on which he was learning how to drive and he was
kind enough to take us&mdash;for which he was afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
deported to Italy. The good man made so much noise
in changing his gears that our progress was advertised in
the uttermost fields, and very few of those who bore
down upon us came unprovided with flowers. Several
of the bouquets hit Pommerol or myself in the eye, and
the Dutch say that the best cause has need of a good
pleader. But the people were so gay, waving their hats
and running after us (they did not always have to run)
and shouting for the various Allies and for President
Wilson. I remember two small round-eyed boys who
were not old enough to run; they were standing hand in
hand by the side of the road, panting the magic word
"Wilson! Wilson! Wilson!" There was a sudden
contrast when we jerked into the village. People were
not rushing towards us, but away from us&mdash;with furious
carabinieri behind them. We got into the garden in
front of the <i>gendarmerie</i>; one of the men was so enraged
that he kept on muttering "Bestia! Bestia! Bestia!"
In the Commandant's office we met Major Federico
Verdinois, the town-major, who said that if he had only
known of our coming this wretched scuffle would not have
happened. Even as he spoke it started again; we leaned
out of the window and saw two or three persons who were
being prevented by soldiers from going down the street
or from going anywhere. An officer was slashing with
a riding-whip at a soldier who was particularly rough.
"One can do nothing with the marines; they are brutal,"
said Major Verdinois. At last there was peace, and the
major said that an Italian deputation would come to see
us. It consisted of six individuals. The Austro-Hungarian
census of 1910 said that the Blato district contained
13,147 Serbo-Croats, 3 Germans and 6 Italians; but these
six were not all in the deputation, for two of its members
had come from Hvar, one from Zadar, two were ex-Austrian
spies and one was a Yugoslav, who hoped in
this way to help his people. One gentleman deplored
that he had not been told about our journey; had he
known he would have told his peasants to appear. Another
gentleman assured us that the peasants were afraid of
declaring their real wishes. Of course a country whose
friends call it the most liberal in the world could not
allow such a state of things to continue, and a short time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
after this the following Order was issued by the staff of
the 66th Division of Infantry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">To the Command of the Royal Divisions.</span></p>

<p>It is necessary to bring about, with no delay and very
discreetly, the dispatch of messages to the Prime Minister
Nitti and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Tittoni from
the mayor, from societies, etc., of this garrison, expressing
the people's keen desire to be annexed to Italy.</p>

<p>A copy of said telegram should be transmitted to me.</p>

</table>
</div>

<p>To return to the events at Blato&mdash;while we were
waiting for the Yugoslavs a woman made her way as far
as the corridor, flung herself down on her knees and
entreated us to protect her. Major Verdinois gave us his
word of honour that no Yugoslav with whom we spoke
would, for that reason, be arrested. Perhaps he was
overruled by his superior officers&mdash;at all events he arrested
and deported to Italy, in the night of June 19, no less than
ten persons, that is, all the Yugoslavs who spoke to us at
Blato, with two exceptions. [We cabled this to the Paris
Conference, and after some delay the unfortunate men
were repatriated.]</p>


<p class="section">WHAT THE MAJOR SAID</p>

<p>For what happened before our arrival I am indebted
to the chemist Radimiri, from whose report the following
is an extract: "At ten in the morning Major Verdinois
had summoned to his office the communal doctor, Moretti,
and the secretary, Draguni&#263;, both of them Yugoslavs.
He told them that two Englishmen who were cruising
about in the <i>Porer</i> would very likely be coming up that
afternoon to Blato and he would permit no sort of demonstration.
The doctor, he said, would be held responsible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
for any disorder; and as Moretti was about to make this
known to the people, who were just coming out of church,
the Italian adjutant approached him with a paper and
ordered him to read it to the Yugoslavs. This document&mdash;it
has been preserved&mdash;is in the Serbo-Croat language
and was given to the doctor because the adjutant, who
did not know the language, mistook it for another one.
<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'If was'">It was</ins> an exhortation to the people, urging them to
have nothing more to do with the Yugoslav <i>intelligentsia</i>,
which had made a great deal of money during the War.
'And you have given your blood for four and a half years
and what has been your benefit?' Dr. Moretti made a
personal appeal for the maintenance of order, and the
people, having called out 'Long live Wilson!' went their
divers ways in peace. Nevertheless three platoons
appeared, each with one officer and one N.C.O. The
adjutant's platoon distinguished itself, for while the
arditi attacked anyone they saw, including women and
children, with the butt end of their muskets, Lieut.
Giovanoni laid about him with a dog-whip. Several of
the soldiers made for a group of four young fellows;
three of them escaped and the fourth, Peter Kraljevi&#263;,
was struck with a rifle so severely across the face that he
was bathed in blood. As he tried to defend himself he
was shot at from a distance of three paces: one bullet
went through his nose, another wounded him in the
forehead. He fell to the ground, and a teacher, Mrs.
Maria Grubisi&#263;, who had witnessed the whole incident,
sank down unconscious at his side and was covered with
his blood. Various other people were injured&mdash;three
little girls received rifle shots in their bodies. All the
main streets were shut off and eight machine guns were
placed in readiness. But the people were not to be
intimidated, and when the Englishmen arrived their
national consciousness was displayed. As a result Peter
&#268;arap was knocked unconscious with a mighty blow of
a musket, the fourteen-year-old Joseph Sule&#382;i&#263; had a
similar experience, and among many others who were
assaulted we will only mention an ex-official, Anthony
Pi&#382;tuli&#263;, a man of sixty, who was struck twice with a
rifle on his stomach and then prevented from going home
but chased out into the fields.... It seemed as if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
would be impossible for our people to have a conversation
with the Englishmen, but at last twenty men and twelve
girls managed to reach that house...."</p>


<p class="section">THE PROTEST OF AN ITALIAN JOURNALIST</p>

<p>I would also give Signor Buonfiglio's dispatch from
this island&mdash;it appeared in the <i>Corriere d'Italia</i> of June 16&mdash;but
more than three-quarters of it is devoted to an account
of some Dalmatian delegates who were received, during
the War, by Francis Joseph and expressed their loyalty.
The deputation was introduced by Dr. Iv&#269;evi&#263;, a Croat;
and if Signor Buonfiglio wants us to deduce from this
how ardently the Croats loved the Habsburgs he will
have to give some other explanation for the very loyal
speeches of his countryman, Dr. Ziliotto of Zadar. But
I presume that his editor did not send Signor Buonfiglio
on this journey to the end that he should write of what
official speakers saw fit to say during the War. As for
the incidents we witnessed and the islanders' aspirations,
he merely says that their welcome to us was an artificial
affair which the Yugoslav committees, with extreme
effort, had organized&mdash;and I don't think that that is a
very illuminating observation.</p>

<p>We learned that on arriving in Blato the Italians
dissolved the town council, on account of its incapacity
to do the work. However, a military man to whom it was
handed over gave his opinion that he had never seen a
better administration.... Out of all that we were told,
I will relate the following: some Italian soldiers were
playing football, and when they kicked the ball into a
maize-field and continued to play amid the maize, the
farmers asked them to desist. Two officers and forty
men were present; they fell upon the three farmers, and
when finally the major commanded them to stop, they
dragged them to the barracks and thrashed them so that
the people in adjacent houses heard them all the night.</p>

<p>On our way to the minute harbour of Pregorica, where
the <i>Porer</i> was waiting for us, we had a repetition of the
scenes enacted between Velaluka and Blato; and a
number of young men, heedless of the risks they ran,
rushed down the mountain-side to Pregorica by the shortcuts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
In the harbour were some carabinieri, as well as
our escorting destroyer. We therefore had to leave without
delay, lest the young patriots should come into contact
with the carabinieri. So very hastily and in a very
illegible scrawl I copied the original letter given on
November 4, 1918, by Lieut. Poggi to the people of
Velaluka: "We Italians," it said, "have come to Velaluka
as the friends of Yugoslavia and of the Entente.
We have come as friends and not as foes, and as such I
ask you to accept us. We are hoisting our flag together
with that of Yugoslavia, and with your friendly consent
we will keep it there until the question of the general
peace is definitely arranged, according to your and our
... according to the principles of ..." The two
missing words are illegible.</p>


<p class="section">INTERESTING DELEGATES</p>

<p>Lying off Kor&#269;ula, that evening, we received the usual
delegates. One of the Italians, Dr. Benussi, said in a
trembling, tearful voice that the Italians were far too good.
And while we were hearing from one of his colleagues
what were his views on the subject of a plebiscite, Dr.
Benussi moaned unceasingly, "I wish I had not come!
I wish I had not come!" He considered that it was
outrageous of us to allude to plebiscites. The Yugoslavs
did not tell us anything very thrilling; the Italian
authorities persisted in writing to the peasants in Italian,
of which they scarcely understand a word. What a pity
that this is not their most serious fault! A barrister
called Dr. Pero Cvili&#269;evi&#263; came, with a companion, to
see us the next day, before breakfast. He said that they,
like most people on the island, were Croats; and he and
his friend belonged to the Serbo-Croat party, which was,
he said, a righteous, though rather a small party, as
the island had been gravely handicapped by the support
which Austria gave the Serbs. "And now," he added&mdash;it
seemed a trifle illogical&mdash;"the people are all very contented.
Believe me," he said. Furthermore, he volunteered
the information that the law was being administered
in the name of the Entente and the United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
It may show a distinct bias on our part, but I fear we
asked him whether the blows from the butt end of muskets
were being applied under the same sanction.... When
we paid our formal visit to the Commandant at his office
on the quay he did not ask if we would care to go to one
of the Italian schools. An American journalist had made
a speech in Rome, describing how he had been taken
to a school at Kor&#269;ula, how the mistress had allowed
him to ask the children if they knew Italian, how they
had raised their hands, and how this had convinced him
that Dalmatia should become Italian. Apparently that
journalist had not been told that prior to the War this
town of some 2000 inhabitants was provided with five
schools in which not a single child spoke Italian, and
with one school subsidized by the Liga Nazionale which&mdash;as
in Albania&mdash;lured its pupils by gifts of clothing,
books, etc. The teachers, from the Trentino, knew not
a word of Serbo-Croat and the children not a word of
Italian. But not very much harm was done, as the
population considered it shameful to attend this school,
and the bribes never succeeded in attracting more than
thirty pupils, even when money was paid to the parents.
This institution was reopened by the Italian army after
the War, and presumably it is the one which the American
visited. I do not know whether the schoolmistress,
forewarned of his visit, had told the children in Serbo-Croat
that a gentleman would come and say something
in Italian, whereupon they would hold up their hands.</p>


<p class="section">A DIGRESSION ON SIR ARTHUR EVANS</p>

<p>Seeing that the Adriatic problem, after all these
months, had not been solved but on the contrary had been
allowed to spread its poison more and more, one naturally
wonders what was being done in Paris. The Conference
was fortunate enough to have at its disposal, after the
Armistice, the famous ethnologist and arch&aelig;ologist Sir
Arthur Evans. This gentleman, whose distinctions are
too numerous to mention (Fellow of Brasenose; twice
President of the British Association; Keeper during
twenty-four years of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
D.Litt.; LL.D.; F.R.S.; P.S.A., and so forth), has for many
years devoted himself to the eastern Adriatic&mdash;the second
edition of his <i>Through Bosnia and the Herzegovina on Foot</i>
appeared in 1877, his <i>Illyrian Letters</i> in 1878, his <i>Slavs
and European Civilization</i> in the same year. He never
ceased from that time onward to study these matters.
"I think," he says in a letter to me from Youlbury, near
Oxford, of which he kindly permits me to make any use
I like, "that in some ways I have more title to speak
on the Adriatic Question than any other Englishman,
as Dalmatia was my headquarters for some years. Neither
did I approach the question with any anti-Italian prejudices.
I was so far recognized as a competent and
moderate authority that I was asked by the Royal
Geographical Society to give them a paper on the subject....
Anxious, with others friendly to both sides, to secure
an equitable agreement between the Italians and Yugoslavs,
I took part in a series of private conferences in
London which led to a preliminary Agreement forming
the basis on which the Congress at Rome approached the
question. There the Agreement was ratified and publicly
approved by Orlando. How Sonnino proceeded to try
to wreck it, you will know. Finally (just before the
Armistice, as it happened) there was to have been a new
Congress of Nationalities at Paris, which I was asked
to attend. It was stopped by the big Allies, as matters
were thought too critical, owing to the submission of
Bulgaria. But I thought it would be useful if I went to
Paris all the same, and I obtained from the Foreign
Office, War Office, etc., a passport vis&eacute;d 'British War
Mission.' Shortly after I arrived in Paris the Armistice
was declared. Soon afterwards, owing to the departure
of Mr. Steed and Dr. Seton-Watson, there was left literally
no one among our countrymen at Paris who knew the
intricacies of the Adriatic Question and the relations of
Italy with the Yugoslavs, and the Yugoslav-Roumanian
difficulties, etc. That being the case, Lord Derby asked
me to be his go-between, and I had an immense lot of
work thrown on my shoulders. I had gone to the expense
of taking a large salon at the Hotel Continental, where I
had private Conferences&mdash;the Yugoslav and Roumanian
leaders there, for instance, discussed the Banat frontier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
question, and the conciliatory proposals made no doubt
furthered the final solution, with which they harmonized.
When there was a serious danger of a clash between the
Italian army and the Serbian forces at Ljubljana, knowing
the imminence of the danger I made such strong representations
to Lord D., which he forwarded to Balfour,
that immediate pressure was exercised at Rome, and the
Italians just drew back in time. I also was able to
convey strong monitions to the other side. I used to
let our Ambassador have a short pr&eacute;cis almost daily of
affairs connected with those regions.... With great
trouble I prevailed on the Yugoslav representatives to
agree to a scheme, which I drew up, for the neutralization
of the East Adriatic coastal waters, and this was taken
up by the Americans&mdash;Colonel House inviting me to
an interview on the subject, in which he expressed his
approval. A copy was also sent to the F.O., and for
this and for several other bits of work useful to the F.O.
I received Balfour's official thanks. I had also many
friendly conversations with prominent Italians in Paris,
and in every way ingeminated agreement between them
and the Southern Slavs. But, meanwhile, I exposed the
Nationalist Italian campaign, to which Sonnino was
privy, in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. Finally I went, at
the end of 1918, for a short holiday to England, Lord
Derby (with whom I always had the friendliest relations)
giving me a diplomatic pass. When, however, early in
January 1919 I prepared to return to Paris, where I had
kept on my expensive rooms, I found difficulties in my
way. Italian intrigue had apparently been on foot. I
was advised to write to Lord Hardinge, and I told him
briefly the circumstances. This great man never answered
or acknowledged my letter, and it was only by
making urgent personal representations at the F.O.
that I finally got the answer that they refused me a passport....
I gather that it was not only Italian intrigue
but the feeling that they did not want 'damned experts.'
And so they blundered on, and to this day"&mdash;the letter
is dated July 17, 1920&mdash;"nothing is settled on the
Adriatic but unsettlement."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE DUPES OF NIKITA IN MONTENEGRO</p>

<p>Meanwhile at intervals during this year there had
been troubles in Montenegro. On three occasions the
Italians at Antivari had endeavoured to extend their
sphere of influence, but the armed civilian population
had been equal to these emergencies and had each time
thrust them back to the coast. At Gaeta, between Rome
and Naples, a very well-paid corps was stationed&mdash;almost
every man was either a commissioned or a non-commissioned
officer. The Italian Government was
asked by Signor Lazari, the Socialist deputy, for what
purpose it allocated 300,000 lire a month to support these
peculiar troops. They were mostly Montenegrins&mdash;relatives
of Nikita, members of the five favoured families,
persons who were stranded and so forth; likewise at
Gaeta were a number of other Yugoslavs who had been
liberated from their Italian internment camps, but many
of them, when they discovered what was expected of
them, revolted. Thirty or forty of them managed to
escape to France, and others to Montenegro, as for
example the man who for twelve years had been Nikita's
porter. He and three others reached Cetinje one day in
August 1920 when I was there. They had with them a
picture-card of the sixty-nine officers of the Gaeta army.
Every one knows every one else in Montenegro and only
two of these officers had held a previous commission.
According to Nikita's Premier, Jovan Plamenac, the
Italian Government considered this as the Montenegrin
army and regarded (rather optimistically) as a loan the
money it contributed to keep it up. In driblets the non-revolting
part of this Gaeta army was taken to the eastern
shores of the Adriatic, for the purpose of making "incidents"
in Montenegro. There was a regular scale&mdash;so
much in cash for the murder of a prefect, so much for
a deputy. One day the father of Andrija Radovi&#263;, a man
of over seventy, was cut down; they waited until everyone
had left the village to go to some f&ecirc;te in a neighbouring
village, and the old man defended himself to
the last.</p>

<p>These emissaries from Gaeta, misguided Montenegrins,
other Southern Slavs and Italians, made considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
use of the mischievous speeches that were sometimes
heard in the British Parliament. They would explain
to some poor, ignorant mountain-dweller that such great
people in England were still discussing Nikita's return,
and if he did return and they had listened to the voice of
Radovi&#263;, woe be to them. Some of these wretched dupes
would follow their seducers, who&mdash;I have no doubt&mdash;would
not only have declined his decorations if they had been
better informed, but would have placed the matter in the
hands of their solicitor, as Gabriel Rossetti threatened to
do if he were ever elected to the Royal Academy. And
yet, after the character of the scoundrel King was fully
exposed, his advocates, so far as I know, had not the grace
to own their error. Of course there was in Montenegro
a certain amount of uninstigated unrest; the wine of
politics, which they were now for the first time freely
quaffing, had gone to their heads&mdash;it was youth against
age, the students were enthusiastic Democrats, the
peasants were sturdy Radicals and they did not always
restrict themselves to dialectical arguments. A certain
number of people had gone to live "u shumi"&mdash;"in the
woods." But the reasons that impelled them were not
so much their devotion to the ex-King, as their own
criminal past or their poverty. Others again had taken
to this life for what may be called reasons of "honour."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Among the brigands was a man who was captured on the
borders of Herzegovina, and before his execution&mdash;he
had murdered seven people&mdash;he declared that he was a
patriot and had done all this for the sake of King Nicholas,
his victims being members of the domineering party.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>But when reminded that one of them was a baby, he
hung his head and said no more.... There was discontent
produced by the high cost of living&mdash;as the
Italians not only held Antivari but even fired on French
boats that were taking supplies up the river Bojana,
it was necessary to revictual all except the new parts
of Montenegro from Kotor. The lack of petrol, from
which even the American Red Cross units were suffering,
compelled the authorities to fall back on ox-waggons,
which at any rate are not expeditious. By the way, it
was the staff of another mission, calling itself the International
Red Cross, which was to blame for adding to the
country's troubles; after they had been installed for a
month or two at Cetinje the people themselves, and not the
authorities, turned them out, on the ground that they
had used the Red Cross to conceal their machinations
in Nikita's interest. The Yugoslav Government was
held up to reprobation in the British Parliament and
press for having hampered more than one British
mission in the work of relieving the <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Montengrins'">Montenegrins</ins>. The
resources of these missions appeared to be moderate&mdash;the
head of one of them had a meeting with Colonels
Fairclough and Anderson of the American Red Cross
and suggested that they should provide him with the
wherewithal for carrying on. But even if their resources
had been scantier their co-operation would have been
very welcome if they had satisfied the authorities that
they were as non-political as the Americans. It was
curious that those who in the British press ventilated the
grievances of these missions were the same people who
championed Nikita.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p><p>The Italians persevered in their man&oelig;uvres&mdash;Nikola
Kova&#269;evi&#263;, the police commissary of Grahovo, sent in
the month of May a confidential man of his to the Italian
General at Dobrota, near Kotor. This man, who speaks
perfect Italian, told the General that ever since 1916 he
had haunted the forests as the leader of a band. Fifty
persons, he said, had attached themselves to him; and he
had now come in for a supply of arms and money, also for
instructions. It would be impossible, said he, to endure
the Serbian troops much longer in the country.</p>


<p class="section">ITALIAN ENDEAVOURS</p>

<p>"You must hold out for a couple of months longer,"
said the General. "I can give you no money at present,
but I can take you on a steamer to San Giovanni, where
we have a camp of the King's friends; and from there
you can easily go to Italy."</p>

<p>"I have given my word of honour," said the man,
"that I will not go without my people. So I must
first of all go back to ask them."</p>

<p>"In a military way," said the General, "the Serbs can
now do nothing. They had tremendous losses in the
war; and in two months the King of Montenegro will
return or else there will be an Italian occupation. Work
hard, my friend. I want you, in the first place, to set
houses on fire; then to shoot officers and officials who
are for Yugoslavia. You should also rob the transports."</p>

<p>Thereupon the man returned to Grahovo and soon
afterwards the French General Thaon, who happened to
go there, spoke with him for two hours and invited him
to his headquarters at Kotor.</p>

<p>The disturbances in Montenegro did not cease; a
country through which you could formerly drive with
less risk than in Paris, was now infested by outlaws and
those who pursued them. And Count de Salis, who had
served as H.B.M.'s Minister at Cetinje, was sent back to
Montenegro on a mission of inquiry. His report was not
published, for the reason that he did not beat about the
bush in his references to the Italians and for the further
reason that he gave the names of those persons from
whom he culled his information. This was a fine opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for the foreign busybodies who were thrusting
their silly little knives into Yugoslavia. "Count de Salis
reports clearly and unmistakably," said Mr. Ronald
M'Neill in the House of Commons, "that in his judgment
the wish of the Montenegrin people is to retain their
own sovereign and their own independence." When
Sir Hamar Greenwood subsequently, speaking for the
Government, threw out a hint that this was not the case,
it was amusing to see how the pro-Nikita party lost their
interest in the report. A certain Mr. Herbert Vivian sent
from Italy in April 1920 a most ferocious indictment
against the Serbs in Montenegro to a London paper called
the <i>British Citizen</i>. He said that the Countess de Salis,
while at Cetinje, was in danger of her life. But the lady
has been dead for many years. I presume this is the
same Mr. Vivian who in a book, <i>Servia, the Poor Man's
Paradise</i>, trembles with rage whenever a Serb speaks
admiringly of Gladstone.</p>


<p class="section">VARIOUS BRITISH COMMENTATORS</p>

<p>Count de Salis's impartial methods did not always
please the population, which was by a large majority
against the former king's return and&mdash;as he clearly
stated&mdash;heart and soul for Yugoslavia. Balkan people
do not yet, to any great extent, appreciate your desire
for truth or even your honesty if you should give a hearing
to their antagonists. The Cetinje public, therefore,
organized a demonstration or two against the Count.
They would have preferred that he should reach the
afore-mentioned conclusions without such an exhaustive
study of the case. He noted that there had been certain
irregularities in the Yugoslav administration, but it was
inevitable that in those unsettled times the inexperienced
officials would not prove equal to every emergency.
These officials, by the way, in 1919 were not Serbs from
Serbia, but for the most part native Montenegrins.
"The country is occupied and administered by foreigners,"
said<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P. "Montenegro," said he,
"is full of Serb officials." I suppose one must receive
it more with sorrow than with anger if a man like Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Massingham of <i>The Nation</i> says that the Serbs "have
deposed the Montenegrin judges, schoolmasters, doctors,
chemists and local officials, and set up their own puppets."
While he might have assumed that the long years of
War had left the Serbs with a very inadequate supply of
officials for the old kingdom, he would have ascertained,
if his sources had been more trustworthy, that Gloma&#382;i&#263;,
the very human prefect of Cetinje, is a native of Nik&#353;i&#263;,
that Milo&#353; Ivanovi&#263;, the mayor, is from the Ku&#269;i, near
Podgorica&mdash;and he was a magistrate under Nikita; that
Bojovi&#263;, the prefect of Podgorica, is a barrister of the
Piperi, while Radoni&#263;, the mayor, was an artillery officer,
then a political prisoner and then the food administrator
under Nikita; that Jaoukovi&#263;, the prefect of Nik&#353;i&#263;, was
a magistrate under the old r&eacute;gime&mdash;he comes, I believe,
from the Mora&#269;a; Zerovi&#263;, the mayor and an ex-magistrate,
is a native of Nik&#353;i&#263;; that the prefect of Antivari, Dr.
Goini&#263;, is a doctor of law whose home is between Antivari
and Virpazar; that Bo&#353;ko Bo&#353;kovi&#263;, the prefect of
Kola&#269;in, won great fame as an officer under Nikita, while
Mini&#263;, the mayor, was Nikita's chief of the Custom-house.
As for the doctors who left the country, these
consisted of Matanovi&#263; and Vulanovi&#263;, who have gone
to Novi Sad and Subotica respectively, as it is easier to
make a living in those towns than in Montenegro. There
are now three Yugoslav doctors at Cetinje (Odgerovi&#263;,
Radovi&#263;&mdash;both of whom were doctors in the time of
Nikita&mdash;and Matanovi&#263;, a young man); they are all
Montenegrins. So, too, with the chemists and the schoolmasters
and the post and telegraph officials&mdash;I am sure
that Mr. Massingham will excuse me if I do not mention
all their names.</p>

<p>Since there are quite a number of Montenegrins in
the Serbian administration and army, all the officers
and men, for example, of the 2nd&mdash;the so-called
"iron"&mdash;Regiment being of Montenegrin origin, one fails
to see for what reason a Serb should be debarred from
posts in Montenegro. It is unfortunate when people
use the word "Montenegrin" without knowing that
there is no separate Montenegrin nation, in the sense
that there is a French or Italian nation. The Montenegrins
are a small section of the Serbian nation, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sought a refuge among the bare, precipitous mountains
and, unlike the other Serbs, maintained its independence.
One should, therefore, to avoid confusion, speak of Serbs
of Serbia and Serbs of Montenegro rather than of Serbs
and Montenegrins. The purest Serbian is spoken in
western Montenegro, on the borders of Herzegovina;
those districts are ethnically different from the southern
region, centring round Cetinje, which is the real old
Montenegro, and the north and north-eastern parts,
called the Brda, which in speech and customs are akin
to the south. In western Montenegro, as in Herzegovina,
the people, who live among their mountains on milk
and its products, are very prolific, having families of
eight or ten children. They are a very healthy, moral
race.</p>

<p>Another pro-Nikita, anti-Serbian writer, excusable
only on account of his insignificance, is Mr. Devine, who
teaches, I am told, at a school near Winchester and seems
very unwilling to be taught. If he wishes, by producing
a book on the subject, to show other people that he knows
painfully little about Montenegro, that is his own affair.
But he is just as ignorant with regard to his hero. He
says that he "is in a position to state that there is not
one single word of truth in the insinuations and charges
impugning the absolute integrity and loyalty of King
Nicholas towards his Allies." The King was, according
to Mr. Devine, a defenceless old man whom it was very
bad form to attack. But the King had been defending
himself at considerable length not only in a harangue
to his adherents in a Paris suburb, but also on various
occasions in a newspaper, the <i>Journal Officiel</i>&mdash;and both
the speech and long extracts from the newspaper are
quoted, with approval, in Mr. Devine's book. This
quaint person is so frantically keen to pour whitewash
over Nikita that he has no time to listen to the main
treacheries of Nikita's career. "Malicious falsehoods!"
he splutters&mdash;and they can be traced to horrible pan-Serbians.
He has reason to believe that they wish to
make Serbia the Prussia of the new Federation; well,
the Croats and the Slovenes and the Bosniaks and all
the others cannot say that Mr. Devine has not warned
them. My Montenegrin friend Mr. Buri&#263; stated in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
columns of the <i>Saturday Review</i> that this odd gentleman
had nourished the ambition of becoming Montenegrin
Minister to the Court of St. James, but that the plan
did not succeed. I never saw Mr. Devine's denial&mdash;perhaps
it fell into the clutches of a ruthless pan-Serbian
printer. Naturally, Mr. Devine would not care to be the
diplomatic representative of a villain; therefore, when
he is brought face to face with certain definite charges
he persists in replying "not in detail, but from the broad
point of view." He is so exceedingly broad that when
an accusation is levelled against the King he sees in this
an accusation against the entire country&mdash;a country
which unfortunately, as he says, "alone of all the Allies
has no diplomatic representative in this country." Mr.
Devine continues unabashed to repeat and repeat his
pro-Nikita stuff in various newspapers. "Il y debvroit
avoir," says Montaigne, "quelque corection des loix
contre les escrivains ineptes et inutiles, comme il y a
contre les vagabonds et fain&eacute;ants...." Not long ago
I happened to see that this egregious person described
himself as "Hon. Minister Plenipotentiary for Montenegro,"
but another gentleman, Sir Roper Parkington,
a pompous wine-merchant, announced in the Press that
he had become "Minister (Hon.) of Montenegro." Perhaps
one of them has resigned, and our poor overworked
Foreign Office will not be invited to decide between a
Minister (Hon.) and an Hon. Minister.</p>


<p class="section">THE MURDER OF MILETI&#262;</p>

<p>The Italians' stay at Kotor was drawing to an end.
"We have no aggressive intentions," said Signor Scialoja,
the Foreign Minister, "and we shall be glad if we are
able to establish with our neighbours on the other side
of the Adriatic those amicable relations"&mdash;and so forth
and so forth. This he said on December 21, but if the
Government was imbued with the same principles in
August it is unfortunate that it omitted to instruct the
responsible officers in Dalmatia. The Yugoslav commander,
Lieut.-Colonel Risti&#263;, heard one night that the
Italian General at Dobrota was harbouring at his residence
no less than twenty-one Montenegrin pro-Nikita komitadjis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
They were clad in Italian uniforms, and, as a torpedo-boat
and a motor-launch were always kept with steam up,
could be shipped off at a moment's notice to Italy.
Colonel Risti&#263; sent his adjutant to make inquiries, and
the Italians gave their word of honour that no Montenegrins
were in the house. In order to avoid a conflict
Colonel Risti&#263; then requested the French General to
send an officer; but this gentleman was not received
by the Italians. Four or five Montenegrins, with an
Italian lieutenant, came out of the house and fired at
the twenty gendarmes who now encircled it. The fire
was returned&mdash;all the Montenegrins and the Italian
were killed. After this the French police disarmed the
remaining Montenegrins and imprisoned them; and on
the following day, much to his chagrin, the Italian
General was told to take up other quarters at Mula, so
that he was separated by the French and the Yugoslavs
from Montenegrin territory.... Not long after this a
certain Captain Mileti&#263; was cycling late one afternoon
on the road to Mula. Five or six Italian soldiers lay
concealed, and so expertly did they murder him that his
friends who were cycling a hundred paces ahead and
other friends who were fishing very near the spot in a
boat heard nothing whatsoever. It was eight days after
this when the Italians had to go from Kotor and the
neighbourhood.</p>


<p class="section">D'ANNUNZIO COMES TO RIEKA</p>

<p>The question of Rieka had not yet been settled. The
more suave Tittoni, who had succeeded Sonnino, was
hoping with the help of France to hold his own against
Wilson. Monsieur Tardieu thought that the town with
a large strip of hinterland should become a separate
independent State under the League of Nations. An
arrangement was also proposed by which the city was
to be administered by Italy, while the Yugoslavs should
have a guarantee of access to the sea. These negotiations
were still in a nebulous state, but certain proposals were
going to be put into force which were suggested by
the Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry. With French,
American, Italian and British representatives this commission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had visited Rieka. One of the recommendations
was to the effect that public order should be maintained
by British and American police; on the very day
(September 12) that the British military police were
to inaugurate their service, Gabriele d'Annunzio took
matters into his own hands. He rose, he tells us, from a
bed of fever and, refusing to recognize the Nitti Government,
he marched with the appropriate theatrical ceremonies,
into his "pearl of the Adriatic." What he
called the 15th Italian victory, or, alternatively, the <i>Santa
Entrata</i>&mdash;the Holy Entry&mdash;was accomplished without
the shedding of a drop of blood. Rieka, the stage of
many fantastic scenes, witnessed one of the quaintest
in the simultaneous arrival at the Governor's palace of
a General to whom the Allies had entrusted the command
of the town and a rebel Lieut.-Colonel who refused to
recognize his authority. They seemed to be on the best
of terms. The General (Pittaluga) informed the Allies
that he was still in supreme command. Being invited
on the following morning to explain the situation at a
conference on board the U.S.S. <i>Pittsburg</i>, at which were
present the Allied naval and military commanders,
General Pittaluga informed them that he would be
responsible for the maintenance of order and that nothing
was to be considered altered in the government of the
town. Forty minutes later, without consulting the
Allies, he had handed over the town to a rebel and he
himself, in his private car, had vanished. In a subsequent
message to the Turkish Minister in Berne, sympathizing
for the Allied occupation of Constantinople, d'Annunzio's
Foreign Department informed him that "the Legionaries
of the Commandant d'Annunzio put to flight the English
police-bullies who were biding their time to snatch the
tortured city." Opinions vary as to whether the poet-pirate
was at that time acting in collusion with Rome&mdash;his
defiance and their thunders being included in the stage
directions&mdash;or whether he was a real rebel. We may
assume that Signor Nitti did not countenance the buccaneer
and that if officers and civil servants diverted Government
cargoes into his hands they were not acting as
Government agents. <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads '(As for'">As for</ins> large numbers of these
officials, their secret understanding with d'Annunzio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
received many proofs. On September 29 the <i>Era Nuova</i>
reported that, two days before, Major Reina, d'Annunzio's
Chief of Staff, was invited to Abbazia, where he had an
interview with the Chief of Staff of the 26th Corps.
Illuminating also is the report, in the <i>Era Nuova</i> of
October 27, of a test case at Genoa, when a sergeant was
tried for leaving his regiment and going to Rieka. The
prosecutor demanded four months' detention and degradation.
The court accepted the plea of the defence,
which was that the court could not condemn or dishonour
a soldier who was only guilty of patriotic sentiment.
Moreover, it transpired that those who returned from
Rieka, after receiving there a salary from both parties,
were granted three weeks' leave and a reward of <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads '100 lire.)'">100 lire.</ins>
One observed that when the <small>s.s.</small> <i>Danubio</i> left &#352;ibenik
for Rieka with sixty waggon-loads of coal, the captain
received his sailing orders from the Royal Italian port-officer.
When d'Annunzio seized Rieka there was on that
same night a solemn demonstration at Zadar, led by
Vice-Admiral Millo, who was supposed to be governing
Dalmatia in the name of the Entente.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">The Consiglio Nazionale Italiano of Rieka, that self-elected
body which had so often told the world that
Rieka was unshakeably determined to be joined to the
Motherland, now took to its bosom the modern Rienzi,
regardless of that which happened to the medi&aelig;val one.
The C.N.I. could now devote itself to serious executive
work, for d'Annunzio&mdash;in spite of or because of his fever&mdash;relieved
them of the rather exhausting task of issuing
proclamations. In three months he sent out something
like a thousand. He did a great many other things&mdash;he
ruined, for instance, the economic life of the town. Everything
had for a time gone swimmingly. The Chief of the
Republic of San Marino was voicing the sentiments of
numberless Italians when he saluted the poet as a great
Italian patriot. Such was the feeling of the majority of
the army and navy, so that the Government in Rome
was made to look ridiculous. "Mark well what I am
telling you," said the poet to the special correspondent
of the <i>Gazzetta del Popolo</i>. "I have received a call from
a superior hidden force, and though the fever burns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
within me I am consoled, because the War has made
me a mystic and I feel I am inspired from on high in this
mission." D'Annunzio and his cohorts refused to have
anything to do with the Cabinet. Signor Nitti, supported
by the Parliament and the more responsible people, was
openly attacked by the Nationalists and secretly by the
profiteers and the newly rich on account of his bold
taxation programme, by which he hoped to bring 30
milliards of francs into the Exchequer. The Nationalists
assisted d'Annunzio to win over the army; and in northern
Italy there were many who realized that an army which
can be moved by such an appeal can, on the next day,
rally to Bol&#353;evism. No other troops remained in Rieka,
the small French and British detachments having been
withdrawn. Before this happened there occurred a
repetition, on a larger scale than usual, of a few French
soldiers being attacked by a body of Italian warriors
who greatly outnumbered them. Some of the French
were Annamites, than whom no more harmless persons
can be imagined.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And it was in order to avoid such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>untoward incidents that the Franco-British troops were
evacuated. D'Annunzio was left to do his worst. Rieka
was one of the problems which the Peace Conference had
failed to solve, and now they were in much the same
inglorious position as the Great Powers who in 1913 warned
Turkey not to mobilize, since they would not allow the
Balkan Confederation to make an attack, and after the
attack gave it out that the Balkan States would not be
permitted to acquire any new territory. The Supreme
Council in Paris was losing its prestige very rapidly. "A
little patience," begged Tittoni, "and my Government
will turn out d'Annunzio." "What we want," exclaimed
Clemenceau, "is a Government in Italy!"&mdash;and the
Italian delegates, with flushed faces, pointed out that it
was not Italy which wanted Rieka, but Rieka which
wanted Italy. They would do their best, although so
many men in Italy were now convinced that Rieka would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>sooner die than give up d'Annunzio. Presently, under his
administration, it began to die. But this was not altogether
distasteful to certain intriguers who were interested in
the future of Triest. There might also arise, to the satisfaction,
of other intriguers, an armed conflict with the
Yugoslavs. But nothing could be calmer than the Yugoslavs'
attitude. Perhaps these barbarians&mdash;as they are
often styled in Italy&mdash;were confident that justice would
prevail. Perhaps they thought that they could bide
their time, and certainly what happened at Trogir was
not calculated to reassure the Italians.</p>


<p class="section">THE GREAT INVASION OF TROGIR</p>

<p>The little, ancient town of Trogir lay some twelve
miles to the south of the demarcation line. Its inhabitants,
with the exception of five Italophil families, are Yugoslav;
and in the month of September 1919 the Yugoslav army
was represented by eight men. Truth compels us to
mention that on a certain night these men, instead of
doing patrol duty, were sleeping off the effects of a carouse;
and when the townsfolk looked out of their windows in
the morning they saw machine guns and Italian soldiers.
At 4 a.m. they had crept into the town with the help of a
certain Conte Nino di Fanfogna, who had assembled a
National Guard of thirty peasants, the employees of those
five families. Conte Nino was striding to and fro; he
muttered threats of death. Some of the chief men, such
as Dr. Marin Katalini&#263;, Dr. Peter Sentinella and others,
came together and were at a loss for some effective means
to chase out the Italians, since they had not even a revolver.
An American boat appeared, but the captain, when appealed
to, said that he was only cruising and could not
come ashore. In the town hall Count Nino, labouring
under some excitement, dismissed the mayor; and when
Ferri, the mayor, told him to go about his business, he
protested that he was the dictator and would, if necessary,
use force. Outside in the square the Italians and the
people stood face to face, and suddenly a few Yugoslav
flags were fluttering, and then an old man, Dr. Sentinella's
father, climbed up to the place in the town hall where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the Italian flag had been hoisted. He tore it down.
The soldiers were for shooting him, but the people began
pulling the rifles out of their hands. Other soldiers, full
of apprehension, dropped their rifles; the people picked
them up, and those who were unacquainted with the
mechanism cried out certain awe-inspiring sounds. Women
and children&mdash;I fear this will not be believed; it is none
the less true&mdash;women and children removed some of the
men's helmets, and one group of children turned a helmet
into a football. "I am a father of a family!" cried a
soldier. "I am innocent, I have been deceived!" cried
another. "O, Mama mia!" cried a third. They wept,
they bolted into the courtyards, and the women showed
them little mercy, for they tore off the men's belts and
even struck them with their fists. A Mrs. Sunjara routed
four men and went home with their machine gun on her
back. In a few minutes the square was free of soldiers,
and forty rifles were stacked in the town hall. Fifty
soldiers on the quay were dealt with by a butcher who
started firing at them; when they heard the shouts of
the approaching crowd they threw down their weapons and
fled. Two large motors escaped; the third was intercepted
at the bridge, and although young Sentinella, who ordered
them to stop, had forgotten his own rifle, they all&mdash;thirteen
men and two officers&mdash;threw theirs away. It
was suggested that the running soldiers should be pursued.
"No," said an old man, "for we would kill them
all. Let them rather go back without arms or helmets.
It will frighten the others." ... Two hours later a party
of Serbian soldiers arrived, but they were not needed,
save for the protection of those who had thrown in their
lot with the Italians. From Split, a few miles away,
1500 volunteers, who speedily assembled, came with
knives or agricultural implements or any other weapon.
"The Yugoslavs must realize," said Nitti, "that it is to
their interest to maintain sincere relations of friendship
with Italy."</p>


<p class="section">THE SUCCESSION STATES AND THEIR MINORITIES</p>

<p>The Yugoslav Government&mdash;as if it had not sufficient
problems to solve&mdash;was ordered now by the Peace Conference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to accept sundry regulations as to the rights of
minorities, the transit of goods, and an equitable r&eacute;gime
for international commerce. The other States which
had inherited the Habsburg Empire were, all of them,
faced with the same demands; and they objected that
to sign such Articles was inconsistent with their
sovereignty. The most onerous item&mdash;relating to the
racial and religious minorities&mdash;had been imposed&mdash;at
America's instance, owing to the manner in which the
Jews were treated in Roumania, despite King Charles'
promises in 1878. The Yugoslavs, with a far smaller
number of Jews and no Jewish outcry, were concerned
only for the principle of independence. Not having
persecuted the Jews they resented having to undertake
that for the future they would act in a liberal spirit.
"I will have nothing to do with tolerance," said the
Orthodox Bishop of Ver&#353;ac to a deputation of Jews,
when he made his formal entry into the town of Pan&#269;evo.
And when they stared at him, "It is not tolerance that
I will show," said he, "but love." Perhaps the Opposition
in the Yugoslav Skup&#353;tina might have exhibited
more kindliness in its attitude towards the Government
and have refrained from rousing a storm against the
signature of the obnoxious Articles. The Government
and the Opposition being practically of equal strength,
the Ministers, who in a calm atmosphere could have
explained the realities of the situation, found themselves
at a grave disadvantage. They could have shown that
they would be assuming obligations which they had
assumed already. In Macedonia, as any traveller could
see, the time-honoured custom of persecuting him who
happened to be the under-dog was abandoned; the
authorities preferred to ignore the religious difference
between themselves and the Bulgarian party, and as the
difference consisted in praying for the Exarch instead of
the Patriarch in the liturgy there was not the slightest
persecution needed to persuade the Exarchists to become
Patriarchists. Many who had been unaware of this new
spirit which informed Yugoslavia and had fled with the
Bulgarian army, afterwards came back to Macedonia.
Nor did the Moslems complain: two Bosnian Moslems were
expressly included in the Cabinet, and every consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
was shown to them&mdash;at Ghevgeli, for instance, where
building material was, after the War, so scarce that
many of the inhabitants had nothing but a hole in the
ground, the prefect caused the two mosques which had
been destroyed by shell-fire to be reconstructed.</p>


<p class="section">OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON THEM BECAUSE OF ROUMANIAN
ANTISEMITISM</p>

<p>If the Serbs were to express their grievance against
the Roumanian ruling class for having landed them in
this position, the Roumanians would reply that the Serbs
do not run the same risk as themselves of being swamped
by the undesirable Galician Jew. The Roumanians argue
that their peasants will go under if they are not shielded.
"In our last great man&oelig;uvres," said the late King
Charles to M. de Laveleye,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> "it was proposed to entrust
the supply of food to Christians. On the first day the
provisions came; on the second everything was late;
on the third day the whole army was dying of hunger.
I was forced to make a hasty appeal to the Jews. They
have great qualities&mdash;they are intelligent, energetic,
economical; but these very qualities make them dangerous
to us on economic grounds." Roumanians acknowledge
that the agrarian policy of a few vast landowners and a
submerged peasantry did not admit of peasants being
made more formidable by increased education, and they
doubt whether their country-folk, so fond of music and
dancing and drinking, have it in them to rival those
Serbian non-commissioned officers who, early in 1919,
became millionaires by skilful operations on the money
market in the Banat. Yet the Serbs are as much addicted
as anyone to the aforementioned delights, and it is probable
that the Roumanian boyars do their own people
an injustice. But while the people were favoured at
the expense of the immigrants&mdash;not always very effectively:
the Jews have been prohibited from owning
land, yet a fifth of the whole of Moldavia belongs indirectly
to a single Jew&mdash;one would suppose that some distinction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>might have been made between the more or less pernicious
alien who is apt to get the village into his toils and that
other Jew whose family has lived perhaps two hundred
years in the country, who feels himself a Roumanian
but is legally a foreigner. One Magder, a Jewish barrister,
performed such exploits at the front during the Great
War that he was mentioned in the communiqu&eacute;, a distinction
only conferred upon two other soldiers. For
one and a half years the official publications insisted on
Roumanizing his name into Magdeu, after which three
Cabinet meetings occupied themselves with the subject
and finally announced that the error was not intentional
but typographical. A French officer wished the
Roumanian Croix de Guerre to be given to him, but
Headquarters refused the request on the ground that he
was a Jew. One cannot blame the United States for
taking the initiative in compelling the Roumanians to
modify their legislation, since the clauses of the Treaty
of Berlin were merely carried out to the extent of naturalizing
a maximum of fifty Jews a year, each case having
to undergo innumerable formalities, accompanied with
payments to deputies and others that rose to 30,000 francs.
Many Jews volunteered for the army in 1913 for the
sake of thus obtaining the naturalization that was promised
them as a reward; but these promises were frequently
not kept. A good deal of injustice occurred
during the Great War: the <i>Moniteur Officiel</i>, No. 261
(of February 2, 1918), printed a decree relating to one
Kaufman, who together with two Christian soldiers had
been away from his corps for twelve days in the previous
September. Kaufman was condemned to death, and
the others to five years' hard labour. When the King
was asked to deal more equitably with the three men,
Kaufman's sentence was commuted to "hard labour
without limit," <i>i.e.</i> for life. It is superfluous to give
many illustrations: at Falticeni seventy-two Jews were
imprisoned without a trial for four months, though twelve
of them were Roumanian citizens and veterans of 1877,
while most of the others had sons at the front; at the
village of Frumusica a major caused the Jews to come out
of their synagogue in order to listen to a speech in which
he advised the Christian soldiers to watch them well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
as they were worse than the Germans. No doubt there
were Jews in the Roumanian army whose patriotism was
less than ardent&mdash;and who can blame them? In the
69th Regiment a special corps of Jews was clothed in the
discarded, dark uniform that was more visible to the
enemy. In the 65th Regiment Jon Dumitru was paid
14 francs a month for spying on his Jewish comrades.
At the battle of Savarat, to cover the retreat of three
battalions, a special corps of Jews was formed&mdash;one
hundred and twenty-two men under a Jewish second
lieutenant; all but three of them were killed or wounded.
After this retreat the General, who lost his head, commanded
that the survivors should be killed wholesale on
account of self-inflicted wounds; but seeing that they
were so numerous (and innocent) he pardoned them, and
only executed two Jews, Lubis Strul and Hascal Simha,
<i>pour encourager les autres</i>. A young doctor, 2nd Lieutenant
Cohn, who came back from Paris, contracted
typhus at the hospital where he was serving; afterwards
he was sent to the 26th Regiment and kept under observation;
it was most suspicious, said the authorities, that
a Jew should return from France for his military service.
A reward of 2000 francs was offered to anyone who could
supply incriminating evidence against the doctor, but
this was offered in vain. The Jews, by the way, were
told that while they would be removed from menial
positions in the hospitals they "would be tolerated" as
doctors&mdash;and nearly a hundred of these doctors died on
active service.</p>

<p>The better class of Roumanians, such as Take Jonescu,
is opposed to such methods&mdash;he was therefore charged with
being in the pay of the Jews, although he was a wealthy
man (a very successful barrister) whom politics made
poorer. It remains to be seen whether the Roumanians&mdash;whose
position with regard to the Jews is, partly through
their own fault, not without peril&mdash;will be willing to put
into effect those reforms to which the Supreme Council
compelled them to subscribe. The Article in question
will probably become a moral weapon, since the Roumanians
regard themselves as on a higher level than
the Balkan peoples, and will not desire that continual
complaints should be made against them. One does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
expect their prejudices and their apprehensions to be
suddenly renounced&mdash;instead of judging each case individually,
the railway administration, after the Government
had agreed that the Jews <i>en bloc</i> could become
citizens, barred them <i>en bloc</i> from that particular service
by requiring that candidates should present their certificates
of baptism. The Agricultural Syndicates have also
introduced a statute which limits their organizations to
Roumanian citizens who profess the Christian religion.
Gradually&mdash;one hopes, for the sake of their country&mdash;the
Roumanians will bring themselves to adopt a less
timorous spirit, and to acknowledge that it is more dangerous
to the Fatherland if a Jew as such is prevented than
if he is permitted to hold the office of street-sweeper.
From such lowly public offices, or from that of University
Professor, no citizen should be excluded on religious
grounds or admitted to them "by exceptional concession."
And if a Jewish cab-driver at Bucharest is so
severely flogged by his passengers outside the chief
railway-station that he succumbs in the hospital to his
injuries&mdash;a fate that overtook one Mendel Blumenthal,
a man fifty-three years of age, in September 1919&mdash;one
trusts that a newspaper article asking for an inquiry
will henceforward not be censored. "It is true," said
Dr. Vaida-Voevod, then the Prime Minister, "that the
Jews still evince some reluctance to assimilate intellectually
with our people or to identify their interests
with those of the Roumanian State. But goodwill
should be shown on both sides, and the overtures should
be reciprocal." Thanks very largely to the former
Liberal Premier, M. Bratiano, whose party was responsible
for much illiberal legislation&mdash;one of his powerful brothers
was popularly said to eat a Jew at every meal&mdash;the
Supreme Council acted in such a manner as to produce
a particularly unwanted crisis in the Yugoslav political
world. Neither Roumanian nor Yugoslav need, in the
opinion of Take Jonescu, have considered that their
dignity was being slighted, for the tendency of the League
of Nations is to limit the free will of each of them. The
cardinal doctrine of the League, as Lord Robert Cecil
has pointed out, is that its members are <i>not</i> masters in
their own house, but must obey the decision of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
majority. However, the Opposition in the Belgrade
Skup&#353;tina could not resist from using the delicate situation
for what many of the deputies thought was a patriotic
course of conduct, and nearly all of them regarded as an
admirable party cry.</p>

<p>I do not know what were the facts ascertained on the spot by Mr.
Hilaire Belloc which enabled him, without any reservations, to inform
the readers of <i>Land and Water</i> (June 5, 1919) that "Zara is quite Italian."
He added that "Sebenia is Italian too." If this be so, how comes it
that in 1919 the Italian authorities found it necessary to terrorize Sebenico
(&#352;ibenik)&mdash;which is presumably the town Mr. Belloc refers to&mdash;with
machine guns and hordes of secret police and the very lurid threats of
Colonel Cappone, the town commandant? I believe it is nearer the
truth to say that the population of this town consists of some 13,000
Yugoslavs and 400 <i>Italianists</i>.</p>

Magrini, had put into his mouth the precise opposite of what he had

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The supplies for the Austro-Hungarian army in Albania had been
concentrated at Rieka. These had to be guarded by Yugoslav troops,
as the Hungarian watchmen at the port had disappeared, and the Russian
prisoners employed there&mdash;about 500 men&mdash;had also vanished. In
order to keep off nocturnal plunderers, the Yugoslav troops were told to
fire a few shots now and then into the air. Is it not possible that the
two Italian boys who, as Mr. Beaumont reported, were hit during the
night by stray bullets and succumbed in hospital to their injuries&mdash;is it
not possible that they were out for plunder and that this incident should
not be used to illustrate what Mr. Beaumont (of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>)
calls "the worst characteristics of Balkan terrorism" on the part of the
troops? During the twenty days of the Yugoslav r&eacute;gime their authorities
sold, as they were justified in doing, tobacco from these warehouses to
the value of 120,000 crowns. It was generally said in Rieka that the
Italians in four days had given away six million crowns' worth, that large
quantities of flour were removed until the British put a stop to this, and
that the robberies were flagrant. These allegations may have been untrue
or exaggerated, but individuals were pointed out who in a mysterious
manner had suddenly become affluent; it would at any rate have been
as well if the I.N.C. had ordered some investigation. Since they failed to
do so, it is natural that gossip flourished. In Triest, by the way, even the
Italian population is reputed to have been disgusted when about forty
waggon-loads of flour and twenty of sugar were taken from the stores of
the former Austrian army and shipped to Italy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Most people have assumed that this was done in order that Rieka
should be left to Austria-Hungary, although they should have taken
with some grains of salt this Italian generosity which presented the
Habsburgs with a good harbour instead of one of those others in Croatia
which the Italians of to-day are never weary of extolling. The real
reasons why Rieka was omitted from the Treaty of London are, as the
<i>Secolo</i> (January 12, 1919) remarks, perfectly well known. "In order,"
it says, "to claim Fiume it is necessary to make appeal to the right of
the people to dispose freely of themselves. In this case the same principle
must be admitted for the people of Dalmatia, who are Slav in a crushing
majority. But this is precisely the negation of the Treaty of London."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The Italianist employ&eacute;s of the Rieka town council who took the census
in 1910 asked the humbler classes if they were acquainted with the Italian
language; those from whom they received an affirmative reply were
put down as Italians. Had they, on the other hand, asked the people
if they spoke Croatian and put down as Croats those who answered yes,
there would, in the opinion of an expert, Dr. Arthur Gavazzi, have remained
not one single Italian&mdash;certainly not the members of the Italian
National Council&mdash;as everyone, he says, speaks and knows Croat. This
is a fairly emphatic proof that the fortunes of Rieka are bound up with
those of its suburbs and the hinterland.</p></div>

claimed supreme command of all the Allied troops, but this the French
General refused, maintaining&mdash;much to the disgust of the Italians&mdash;that
he was under the orders of Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey, who was then in command
of the Army of the Orient. The Italians were so determined to preserve
in their own hands the military supremacy that a very senior General,
one Caneva, was kept in the background of the palace with the sole object
of stepping forward if any Allied officer senior to General Grazioli should
by chance be posted to the town. The disrespectful Allies used to call
Caneva "the man in the cellar."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The town of Yugoslavia which, after Austria's collapse, was stirred
the most profoundly by its postage stamps was Zagreb. In order to
commemorate the establishment of the new State the Croatian Post
Office published four stamps, which were on sale on November 29. The
whole edition consisted of 100,000 stamps, of which 24,000 were allotted
to Zagreb, the rest going to other parts of the province. It was obvious
that there would be a great demand for these stamps, and in order to
check any abuses or clandestine traffic it was decided that they should
be sold nowhere but at the post offices, also that each purchaser would
only be allowed to buy a limited quantity. At 8 a.m. the sale began,
but at seven many hundreds of people were waiting outside the chief
post office, the post office at the station and another in the Upper Town.
The face value of the four stamps, added together, was one crown. At
first they were resold for between 4 and 20 crowns, then the price jumped
to 30, and by 10 a.m. the 45-heller stamp (of which only 15,000 had been
printed) was sold out. Collectors were paying 8 or 10 crowns for it, in
order to complete their sets. At noon the offices were all shut, as the
rush was considered too dangerous. More than 1000 persons were in
the great hall at the Head Office and another 2000 were gathered outside.
Nearly all the windows where the stamps were being sold were broken.
At the Station Post Office the people began to fight with the sentries.
The National Guard had to be sent for. At 4 p.m. the post offices had
no stamps left (and citizens who had been waiting all day to buy an
ordinary stamp could not be served). At 5 p.m. people who for the first
time in their lives were taking an interest in philately, wanted 300-500
crowns from collectors for a whole series. Between 5 and 6 p.m. a stamp
exchange was held in the entrance hall. Eight hundred to one thousand
crowns were being demanded for the series. Soldiers were willing to
give the four stamps in exchange for a pair of boots, others were asking
for sugar, coffee or petrol. The price which was ultimately established
was 250 crowns.</p></div>

one. It is the report, given in his words, of a Dalmatian, a native of
Sinj, who having been an emigrant could write in English. "On July
1915 I came to the Italian front, and on the morrow I went across the
lines and deserted to the Italians. As soon as I arrived at the station
of internment I requested the Command to be admitted as a voluntary
into the Serbian army. This petition of mine was answered by Italian
authorities in the negative. After the Congress of Rome in 1918 I and
some of my comrades who had recently applied for admission were
permitted to join the Yugoslav legion on June 1. I was right away
sent to the front of the Tyrol, where on August 7 I was wounded in a hard
bayonet fight. On this occasion I was decorated by the Italian Commander
for valour. After 45 days of hospital by my own request I was
sent to the front, where I remained up to the break-up of Austria or until
we Yugoslav legion were disarmed by Italians and as a reward for our
participation in the war we were interned as prisoners of war at Casale
di Altamura in the province of Bari. Four days after my internment
I succeeded in sliding away, so that on the Christmas Eve I was again in
Dalmatia.

For years they persisted in demanding the execution of whatever in the
Treaty or Pact of London was obnoxious to the Serbs, while they regarded
as obsolete another clause, respecting the formation of a small independent
Albania, which was distasteful to themselves, and&mdash;if I rightly understand
the Italophil Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Goad&mdash;they were justified because, forsooth,
Bulgaria had entered the War on the other side. To say that the idea of
this small Albania, with corresponding compensations to the Serbs and
Greeks, was held out as a bribe to the Bulgars does not seem to me a
very wise remark. However, "ne croyez pas le p&egrave;re Bonnet," said
Montesquieu, "lorsqu'il dit du mal de moi, ni moi-m&ecirc;me lorsque je dis
du mal du p&egrave;re Bonnet, parce que nous nous sommes brouill&eacute;s." Let the

Treaty, he went to Petrograd and saw Sazonov. The interview is said to
have been stormy, for the Russian Minister, according to the <i>Primorske
Novine</i> (April 23, 1919), "had not the most elementary knowledge of
the Slav nature of Dalmatia, still less of Istria, Triest, Gorica and the rest."
Mr. Asquith, whom Supilo afterwards visited in London, is said to have
been no better informed than Sazonov.</p></div>

with Plamenac's antecedents than he was with other Montenegrin affairs,
which he raised on more than one occasion in the House of Lords, endeavouring

man at Antanfalva (Kova&#269;i&#269;a) who, having lost something between his
house and the post office, insisted on advertising for it in the Buda-Pest
papers. But the Yugoslav rule was so satisfactory that, two or three
years after the Armistice, I found in the large Hungarian village of
Debelyacsa&mdash;where the <i>intelligentsia</i> called the sympathetic Serbian
notary by his Christian name&mdash;not one of the inhabitants proposed to
remove to Hungary. No doubt the goodness of the soil had something
to do with this decision, but, more, the liberal methods of the Serbs. No
military service was as yet exacted&mdash;all that the Magyars had been asked
to do was to work for two months in obliterating the ravages of war.
The priest and the schoolmaster who had come from Hungary before the
War still exercised their functions, and&mdash;in contrast with what had
previously been the case&mdash;both the Magyar and the Serbian language
were taught, the latter from the third class upwards. Altogether there
was perfect harmony between the Magyars and the Serbs; when I was
there the only racial question which occupied the Magyar farmers was
the resolve of their <i>intelligentsia</i> to have, as centre-half in the football
team, not a Magyar but a more skilful Jewish player.</p></div>

was bound to behave to Italy, one of the Great Powers, with a certain
deference. They also recognize that the Foreign Office is not actuated by
malevolence if she treats Belgrade as she did Morocco, when in place of
the strikingly appropriate and picturesque appointment of Sir Richard
Burton our Legation there was occupied by one of a series of diplomatic
automata. After all, these automata, who have spent more or less laborious
years in the service, have to be deposited somewhere. But if one does
not demand of the Foreign Office that she should make a rule of sending
to the Balkans, where the personal factor is so important, such a man as
the brilliant O'Beirne, who during the War was dispatched too late to
Bulgaria, yet a moderate level should be maintained&mdash;it has happened
before now that we have been represented in a Balkan country by a
Minister who, some time after his arrival, had not read a Treaty dealing
with those people and of which Great Britain was one of the high contracting
parties; when taxed with this omission the aforesaid Minister
hung his head like a guilty schoolboy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> This has been done, but to a much more limited extent, in Hungary
where several hundred men who distinguished themselves in the European
War have been granted the Gold Medal for Bravery, which entitles each
of them to a goodly portion of land. This the recipient may not sell,
but he need not leave it to his eldest son if a younger one is more interested
in agriculture. Each medallist, by the way, is authorized to exhibit
outside his house a notice which informs the world that he possesses this
most treasured decoration; but perhaps to our eyes the strangest privilege
the Medal carries with it is the permission to write "Vitez" (which is
the Hungarian for "brave") in front of the name. Thus if Koranji
Sandor is decorated he is to call himself henceforward Vitez Koranji
Sandor, and that is the correct address on an envelope. Not only is the
honorific awarded to him, but is to be used by all his sons and by their
sons. We might imagine that a man would shrink from permanently
calling himself Brave John Smith, especially if he has been very brave,
but the average Magyar will not feel excessively awkward, since he is
not altogether repelled by that which is garish.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The Czechs believe that Agrarian Reform should be the work of a
generation. They are beginning on the very large estates, those which
run to more than 50,000 hectares, and in calculating the price to be paid,
40 per cent. is deducted for the State on properties of this size. On those
of between 20,000 and 50,000 hectares 30 per cent. is deducted, and so
on down to the 5 per cent., which is appropriated from the holdings of
from 1000 to 2000 hectares. It is also the Government's intention in
Czecho-Slovakia to take in hand such properties as are badly administered,
and, by a wise proviso, when a denunciation arrives to the effect, for
example, that the proprietor is not using manure and that thus the State
is suffering injury, a dozen men, belonging to the various political parties,
go down to investigate. If they find that the accusation is not justified and
that the place is satisfactorily worked, then the man who made the charge
is obliged to pay the examining committee's expenses.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The trouble arose at the end of May when a number of citizens of
&#352;ibenik, men and women, donned the American colours as a compliment
to the sailors of the U.S. warship <i>Maddalena</i>, who had taken to wearing
those of Yugoslavia. The &#352;ibenik ladies and men, relying perhaps on
the words of Admiral Millo with regard to Allied colours, never dreamed
that any objection would be made. But suddenly one evening everybody
with these colours was attacked by Italian soldiers, who tore them off
and explained that it was done by the General's order. Italian officers
did not interfere while ladies were being very roughly handled. A certain
Jakovljevi&#263;, a shopkeeper, who had sold an American flag, was imprisoned.
On the same evening a number of prominent citizens were summoned
before the town commandant, Colonel Cappone, who spoke as follows:
"A Croat, a Croat has dared to display a flag before an ardito!" [An
American flag.] "This fool! instead of giving him a black eye, the
ardito pulled off his flag. This is Italy! Mind you don't go to the
<i>Maddalena</i> to-morrow! Whatever it costs me, I shall prevent it! You
are the leaders who will be responsible for anything that happens to-morrow."
[This was the eve of the Italian national celebration of June 1.]
"Our arditi are blood-thirsty; do not be surprised if some lady of
yours receives a black eye.... We are the masters here! This is
Italy! This is Italy! We have won the War, we have spent milliards
and sacrificed millions of soldiers." On this Mr. Mi&#353;e Ivanovi&#263; remarked:
"I beg your pardon, but the Paris Conference has not yet decided the
fate of these territories." And the Colonel replied, "It has been decided!
But even if we had to leave, remember that on taking down our flag we
shall destroy everything, with 5000 machine guns, 2000 guns and 40,000
men! Good night, gentlemen." This declaration made by the town
commandant, presumably a responsible officer, was testified by the
signature of all those who were present.... When, in 1921, the Italians
were leaving &#352;ibenik they destroyed a large number of young trees in the
park and elsewhere. The Venetians, in the Middle Ages, had cut down
millions of Dalmatian trees, but always with a utilitarian purpose.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> In view of what the census said with regard to this place it is superfluous
to add that when an Italian officer in my hearing asked one who
was stationed there if there was any social life, the other answered:
"None at all; the whole population is Slav." I find that <i>Modern Italy</i>
(published in London) quoted with approval the following telegram
which appeared, it said, in the <i>Tempo</i> of May 9: "A remarkably enthusiastic
celebration took place at Obrovazzo. Several thousands, including
representatives of the neighbouring villages, formed a procession and
marched through the town. In the principal piazza, the President of
the National party, Bertuzzi, delivered a stirring speech, which was
enthusiastically applauded."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> It is customary for Serbian officers to wear but one decoration, the
highest among those to which they are entitled. To illustrate this
Serbian modesty regarding honorifics, I might mention that one evening
at the house of a Belgrade lawyer I heard his wife, a Scotswoman, to
whom he had been married for more than a year, ascertain that he had
won the Obili&#263; medal for bravery and several other decorations which&mdash;and
his case was typical&mdash;he had not troubled to procure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Mr. Leiper in the <i>Morning Post</i> (June 23, 1920) scouts the idea of
these malcontents being the supporters of Nikita, who "were all laid by
the heels or driven out of the country long ago&mdash;largely by the inhabitants
themselves." He observes that the land is one land with Serbian soil&mdash;its
frontiers are merely the artificial imposition of kings and policies.
The nations, he points out, are not two but one&mdash;one in blood, in temperament,
in habits, in tradition, in language; round the fireside they tell
their children the same stories, sing them the same songs: the greatest
poem in Serbian literature, as all the world knows, was written by a
Prince-Bishop of Montenegro. Since the day when the Serbian State
came into existence it has been, he says, the constant, burning desire of
the Montenegrins to be joined to it. We may well rub our eyes at a letter
in the same newspaper from Lord Sydenham, who makes the perfectly
inane remark that this constant, burning desire was never probable.
"Montenegro already <i>is</i> Serbia," says Mr. Leiper, "and Serbia Montenegro,
in every way except verbally." But Lord Sydenham has set himself
up as a stern critic of the Serbs in Montenegro; therefore he cannot
countenance the Leiper articles, which give him "pain and surprise."
Is he surprised that Mr. Leiper, a shrewd Scottish traveller, who is acquainted
with the language, should disagree with him? "The great
mass of the people," says Mr. Leiper, "are as firm as a rock in their
determination that Nicholas shall never return." Listen to Lord Sydenham:
"I am afraid," says he, "that your correspondent has been
misled by the raging, tearing Serbian propaganda with which I am
familiar." And he quotes for our benefit an unnamed correspondent of
his in Montenegro who says that the people there are terrified of speaking.
It is much to be desired that a little of this terror might invade a gentleman
who plunges headlong into matters which he does not understand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> A most vivid account of this affair was contributed to the <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> (July 13, 1919) by its correspondent, Thomas Stewart Ryan,
one of the two neutral eye-witnesses. He came to the conclusion that
as Italy was an interested party and was exasperated by the long delay in
the decision, an outbreak even more violent might occur unless her forces
were brought down to the level of the other Allies. In alliance with the
city rabble, the Giovani Fiumani, Italian soldiers attacked the French:
"I can state emphatically," says Mr. Ryan, "that the French guards
did nothing whatever to provoke the assault, some details of which would
blot the escutcheon of most savage tribes. I saw soldiers of France killed,
after surrender, by their supposed Allies.... I could scarcely believe
my ears when Italian officers rapped out the order to load. But they
seemed to remember that Frenchmen can fight." However, he also saw
an Italian officer who "prevented this murder and held back the civilians
who were trying to reach their victim. I must record it to the credit of
this officer that his was the only Italian voice to defend the game little
soldier. 'A hundred against one! Shame on you, soldiers of Italy!' I
wish I knew this officer's name." At another part of the harbour, "A
British naval officer, fearing that the wounded Frenchman would be
stabbed inside the court to which he was dragged, followed the body and
defied the captain of carabinieri, who ordered him to leave." And at the
close "I was no longer alone with my friend as a neutral eye-witness.
The British Admiral Sinclair appeared, causing much perturbation to
the Italian officers, who though some of them had just taken part in
the shambles, were already glib with excuses. 'The British Admiral
wants to know' was enough to bring the Italian officer running and
bowing, with 'I beg of you....' 'We are willing to explain all....'
American naval officers of the destroyer <i>Talbot</i> were also among this
post-mortem crowd. In a French motor bearing two Italian officers
who stood up to ward off possible shots, came a French captain. He was
of that calm, splendid type that makes you think of the Chevalier Bayard,
a knightly figure. Quietly he moved among his dead. Not by the
flicker of an eyelid did he give token of what was working deep down in
that French heart of his. I heard an Italian officer tell him that the
French had started the most regrettable affair by firing on the Italian
ships. The officer spoke this falsehood under the glazed stare of the
French dead and the protesting gaze of the wounded. The French captain
nodded his head, remarked, 'Oh yes! of course. Now we must only
pick up the wounded,' and, with all the gentleness of a mother beside her
child's sick-bed...." A very good account of this shocking episode
is contained in <i>A Political Escapade: The Story of Fiume and d'Annunzio</i>,
by J.&nbsp;N. Macdonald, O.S.B. (London, 1921). His narrative is extremely
well documented&mdash;he appears to have been a member of the British
Mission. "It is incomprehensible," says he, "how officers and men
could attack the very post that they had been sent to defend. Moreover,
they were over 100 strong and fully armed, whereas the French garrison
was small and had no intention of putting up a defence." One of the
lesser outrages described by Father Macdonald, since it was not attended
with fatal results, was that which happened to Captain Gaillard, who
from his window saw an Italian lieutenant shoot and kill with his revolver
an unarmed Annamese. The captain cried out with rage, and when his
room was entered by fifteen men carrying rifles with fixed bayonets and
they ordered him to go with them, Madame Gaillard tried to intervene
and received a blow on the arm dealt with the butt end of a rifle. At
this juncture an Italian officer appeared and roughly told Gaillard to come
without further delay. A mob of civilians and soldiers who were outside
greeted Gaillard with a shower of blows, and while they went along the
street, the officer escorting him kept up a volley of abuse against France
and England. Very fortunately for Gaillard he was brought into the
presence of an Italian officer to whom he was personally known. This
gentleman, looking very uneasy, refused to give the name of his brother-officer,
but caused the Frenchman to be released.</p></div>

stricken town&mdash;Hopes in the Little Entente</span>.</p>


<p class="section">D'ANNUNZIO SPREADS HIMSELF</p>

<p>When the Serbian army came, during the Balkan
War, into the historic town of Prilep a certain soldier sent
his family an interesting letter, which was found a few
years afterwards at Ni&#353; and printed in a book. One
passage tells about a conversation as to a disputed point
of medi&aelig;val history between the soldier and a chance
acquaintance. "Brother," said the Serb, "whose is this
town?" And the man of Prilep recognized at once that
his catechist was not referring to the actual possessor but
to Marko of the legendary exploits. When the same
question was asked of Gabriele d'Annunzio he said that
Rieka was Italian then and for ever, and that he who
proclaimed its annexation to Italy was a mutilated war-combatant.
Most of the citizens, as time went on, began
to think that they would sooner hear about Rieka's
annexation to another land, which was the work of Nature.
Those who did not entertain this view were the salaried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
assistants of d'Annunzio and the speculators who had
bought up millions of crowns in the hope that Italy, as
mistress of Rieka, would change them into lire, even if
she did not give so good a rate as at Triest. The poet
addressed himself to the France of Victor Hugo, the
England of Milton, and the America of Lincoln, but not
to the business men of Rieka, who would have told him
that 70 per cent. of the property, both movable and
immovable, was Yugoslav, while 10 <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'per cent'">per cent.</ins> was Italian
and the rest in the hands of foreigners. Not waiting to
listen to such details, d'Annunzio sailed, with a thousand
men, to Zadar, had a conference with Admiral Millo, and
won him over. Whether he would have persuaded
Victor Hugo, Milton or Abraham Lincoln, we must gravely
doubt. "I am not bound to win," says Lincoln, whom we
may take as the spokesman of the trio, "but I am bound
to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound
to live up to what light I have. I must stand with anybody
that stands right; stand with him while he is right,
and part with him when he goes wrong." In view of the
wilful trespass committed by Italians on the property
and rights of the Yugoslavs and the oft-repeated
guarantees of protection given to the Slavs by the
American Government against such invasion, it is passing
strange that d'Annunzio should have appealed to
Abraham Lincoln of all people. As for Admiral Millo,
he telegraphed to Rome that he had thrown in his
fortunes with those of d'Annunzio, and he made to the
populace a very fiery speech. It is not known whether
he communicated with the France of Clemenceau, the
England of Lloyd George and the America of Wilson,
whose representative he apparently continued to be for
the rest of Dalmatia, while relinquishing that post with
regard to Zadar, his residence.</p>


<p class="section">THE WAVE OF ITALIAN IMPERIALISM</p>

<p>If Admiral Millo's rebellion had been published in
the press of November 16th, it is most likely that 250,
instead of 160, Socialists would have been successful at
the General Election&mdash;an election which Signor Nitti,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that very able parliamentarian, had brought about for
the purpose, amongst other things, of testing the forces
and popularity of the Nationalist party. The old Chamber
had&mdash;voicing the wishes of the people&mdash;voted for
the open annexation of Rieka, without war or violence;
the Nationalists, in order to gain their ends, would
seemingly have stopped at nothing. Military adventures,
the breaking of alliances, agrarian and industrial upheaval&mdash;it
was all the same to them. They scoffed at the
common sense of the imperturbable Nitti when he said
that the Italians, like their Roman ancestors, must return
to the plough. Furiously they harped upon the facts
that bread was dearer now, that coal was nearly unprocurable.
And Giolitti, who in 1915 had strenuously
tried to keep the country neutral, said in a great speech
before this 1919 election that the War had been waged
between England and Germany for the supremacy of the
survivor and that Italy should never have participated.
He enlarged upon the fearful sufferings of his countrymen,
and he compared the gains of Italy with those of her
Allies. Nor was he deterred when Signor Salandra, the
former Premier, called him Italy's evil spirit who, devoid
of any patriotism, would have sold the Fatherland to the
Central Powers for a mess of pottage. Giolitti, on whom
300 deputies had left their cards in the tragic hours before
the declaration of war, had good reason to know that
even if Giolittism had melted away, the House had
secretly remained Giolittian.</p>

<p>A new electoral system was introduced, whereby the
people voted for programmes and parties rather than
directly for individual candidates. This, it was hoped,
would render corruption more difficult by enclosing the
individual within the framework of the list, and it was
also hoped that there would be less violence than usual.
As a matter of fact there probably was a diminution with
respect to these two practices, but only because of the
large number of abstentions&mdash;merely 29 per cent. voted in
Rome, 38 per cent. in Naples, and in Turin scarcely more.
The people were tired of the excessive complexity and
dissimulation of Italian politics. There was a good deal
of violence&mdash;in Milan, Florence, Bologna and Sicily the
riots were sometimes fatal&mdash;and with such an electorate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
more extensive than heretofore, so that symbols had
often to be used instead of the printed word, it was to be
expected that there would not be an atmosphere of even
relatively calm discussion. At Naples 132 candidates
struggled for eleven seats&mdash;their meetings were indescribable.
And it may be thought that in such conditions
the victorious parties would not necessarily
reflect the wishes of the country. The Nationalists were
dispersed, the Giolittians were routed&mdash;the Socialists
increased from 40 to 156, and the Catholics from 30 to 101.
Gabriele d'Annunzio had been the Socialists' chief elector.</p>


<p class="section">THEIR WISH FOR RIEKA, DEAD OR ALIVE</p>

<p>There was now a fair hope that the Government would
be in a position to solve the Adriatic problem. The
Italian delegates in Paris had suggested that, in the
independent buffer State, Rieka should have a separate
municipal status, and that a narrow strip of land should
join the buffer State to Italy. On December 9, a memorandum
was signed by the representatives of Great Britain
and America, which was the best compromise which anyone
had yet proposed. The strip was dismissed as being
"counter to every known consideration of geography,
economics and territorial convenience." [Nevertheless
this very dangerous expedient of the strip, after having
been thus roundly rejected by the Allies, formed a part
of the Treaty of Rapallo in November 1920&mdash;the Yugoslavs
had most generously given way rather than leave this
exasperating Adriatic problem still unsolved.] Rieka
with her environment was to be a <i>corpus separatum</i>&mdash;and
this was the chief point which made the proposals inacceptable
to Italy. That Socialist group which is
represented by the <i>Avanti</i> seemed to be the only one
whose attitude was not intransigeant. The question of
Rieka, it argued, was not isolated, but should be considered
as one of the numerous questions of Italian foreign
politics. It laughed at those who every moment cry "Our
Fiume," because there are in the town many people who
speak Italian. Other groups of Socialists had altered very
much from the day when the three delegates&mdash;Labriola,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Raimundo and Cappa&mdash;spoke of the Adriatic at the
Congress which Kerensky summoned to Petrograd.
Labriola was considered the most arrogant and chauvinist
of the trio, but not even he demanded Rieka&mdash;there was
no question of it at the time. Still less did he dream of
Zadar or &#352;ibenik; what he pleaded for was Triest, Istria
and an island.... In December 1919 some Italian
Socialist papers were printing reports on the economic
life of Rieka, which was in a disastrous condition. But
the great majority of Italians were so bent upon securing
Rieka that they did not seem to care if by that time she
were dead. And they threw a little dust into their eyes,
if not into the eyes of the Entente, by declaring that if they
did not annex Rieka that unhappy, faithful town would
annex them. The self-appointed Consiglio Nazionale
Italiano of Rieka was, however, at this time less preoccupied
with the Madre Patria than with her own very
troublesome affairs; she had no leisure to organize those
patriotic deputations to Rome, which sailed so frequently
across the Adriatic and which, as was revealed by Signor
Nitti's organ <i>Il Tempo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> were too often composed of
speculators who liked to receive in Italy the sum of
60 centesimi for an unstamped Austrian paper crown
that was barely worth ten. The disillusioned C.N.I.
would have given a good many lire to be rid of d'Annunzio;
the citizens were invited to vote on the following
question: "Is it desirable to accept the proposal of
the Italian Government, declared acceptable by the
C.N.I. at its meeting of December 15, which absolves
Gabriele d'Annunzio and his legionaries from their oath
to hold Rieka until its annexation has been decreed and
effected?" On December 21, in the Chamber, Signor
Nitti announced that more than half the citizens had
voted and that four-fifths of them were in favour of the
suggestion of the C.N.I. But d'Annunzio, whose adherents
by no means facilitated the plebiscite, proclaimed
it null and void. Yet, after all, Italy had likewise, on
every occasion when the Yugoslavs suggested a plebiscite
under impartial control, refused to sanction it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p class="section">FRUITLESS EFFORTS OF ITALY'S ALLIES</p>

<p>Then suddenly a ray of light shone through the
clouds. The ever-cheerful Signor Nitti, after a conference
with Lloyd George and Clemenceau&mdash;no Yugoslav
being present, whereas Signor Nitti was both pleader and
judge&mdash;was authorized to say that the December memorandum
had been shelved. Terms more favourable to
Italy were substituted and the Yugoslav Government
were told they must accept them. One of these terms
was to modify the Wilson line in Istria, ostensibly for
the protection of Triest and in reality to dominate the
railway line Rieka-St. Peter-Ljubljana; another of
the terms was to present Italy with that narrow corridor
which in December the Allies had so peremptorily disallowed.
No wonder the American Ambassador in
France gave his warning. "You are going," he said,
"much too far and much too quickly. President Wilson
cannot keep pace with you." The French Government
was passing through a period of change, and these new
proposals, as was underlined in the <i>Temps</i>,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> emanated
from London. Mr. Lloyd George, who may have wished
for Signor Nitti's aid in his offensive against France in
the Russian and Turkish questions, was this time very
badly served by his intuition. The Yugoslavs were
ordered to accept the new proposals or to submit to the
application of the Treaty of London, that secret and
abandoned instrument which&mdash;to mention only one of
the objections against it&mdash;provided for complete Yugoslav
sovereignty over Rieka, a solution that, in view of Italy's
inflamed public opinion, was for the time being impracticable.
And while the Yugoslavs were told that
Rieka would, under the Treaty of London, fall to them,
no details were given as to how d'Annunzio was to be
removed. "Nous sommes dans l'incoh&eacute;rence," as
Clemenceau used to say of the political condition of
France before the war. Seeing that the Italian Government
and the C.N.I. had shown themselves so powerless,
were France and England going to turn the poet out?
But Mr. Lloyd George was more fortunate than Disraeli,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>whose error in the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina
had had such dire results; on February 13, a very firm
note was issued by President Wilson, which compelled
France and Great Britain to withdraw from the position
they had taken up. Wilson would have nothing to do
with the notorious corridor, though Clemenceau had said
on January 13, to the Yugoslav delegates: "Si nous
n'avions pas fait cette concession, nous n'avions pas eu
le reste." "The American Government," said Wilson,
"feels that it cannot sacrifice the principle for which it
entered the war to gratify the improper ambition of one
of its associates, Italy, to purchase a temporary appearance
of calm in the Adriatic at the price of a future world
conflagration." The rejoinder of the French and British
Premiers was a trifle lame, and when they ventured to
add that they could not believe that it was the purpose
of the American people, as the President threatened, to
retire from the treaty with Germany and the agreement
of June 28, 1919, with France unless his point of view was
adopted in this particular case, which, in their opinion,
had "the appearance of being so inadequate," they were
not caring to remember that while their own countries and
Italy were suffering from a lack of food-stuffs and provisions
were being imported at a disastrous rate of
exchange from the United States, the products of Yugoslavia,
such as meat and meal, could not be obtained
because Rieka, which ought surely to serve its hinterland,
was at that moment not available, owing to
d'Annunzio. At the same time the President did not go
to the opposite extreme of simply allocating the port to
Yugoslavia, which the application of the Treaty of
London would involve. He preferred to act on the
principle that the differences between Italy and the
Yugoslavs were inconsiderable, especially as compared
with the magnitude of their common interests. And
direct negotiations between the two parties were to be
recommended, with the proviso that no use be made of
France and Great Britain's immoral suggestion that an
agreement be reached on "the basis of compensation
elsewhere at the expense of nationals of a third Power."
It had indeed been proposed that the Yugoslavs should
be bribed by concessions in Albania, but this idea was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
very explicitly rejected and on more than one occasion
by the Yugoslav delegates in Paris.</p>

<p>While, in the following months, the Yugoslavs and
the Italians negotiated, the task of their delegates was
impeded by the occasional Cabinet crises in Belgrade
and in Rome. It was made no easier by those Italians
who clamorously objected to the remark of Clemenceau,
when he said that both Yugoslavs and Italians had been
compelled to fight in Austria's army. The <i>Corriere
d'Italia</i> told him that he displayed the zeal of a corporal
to defend the Yugoslavs. After alluding to his "historical
inexactitudes," it reminded him of the Italians
who were slain at Reims and the Chemin des Dames,
but as usual omitted to speak of the French soldiers who
fell in Italy. And, while the negotiations were being
carried on, Gabriele d'Annunzio clung to his town. The
compromise of a mixed administration seemed to have
small chance of being realized. It had been proposed by
that Inter-Allied Commission which was set up to investigate
the circumstances of the French massacre; and
the Italian delegate, General di Robilant, not only said
in his report<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> to the Senate that this compromise was
most favourable for Italian aspirations but he is alleged
also to have included some very drastic criticism of the
actions of the high military authorities, whom he charged
with unconstitutional interference. Nevertheless neither
the poet nor the Premier were as yet in a tractable
mood with regard to the Rieka problem. Signor Nitti,
parading his bonhomie, championed the cause in a more
statesmanlike fashion; he did not, like d'Annunzio,
evoke the world's ridicule by his footlight attitudes and
those of his faithful supporters who, when his "Admiral"
Rizzo abandoned him, when Giorati his confidant withdrew,
when even Millo advised moderation, took certain
piratical steps in order to keep the garrison supplied with
food,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and composed an anthem which on ceremonial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>occasions was chanted in the poet's honour. But when
Signor Nitti observed, with the utmost affability, that
Rieka had, after the fall of the Crown of St. Stephen,
become mistress of her own fate and as such, regardless
of the Treaty of London, asked for inclusion in Italy,
he, the Prime Minister, was vying in recklessness with
d'Annunzio. The prevailing sentiment both in Triest
and Rieka, said the <i>Times</i>,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> was that both these towns
should become free ports in order to serve their hinterlands,
which are not Italian. "Italy is neglecting Triest
in favour of Venice," says the dispatch. In Rieka,
where the situation was even worse, "an honest plebiscite,
even if confined to the Italian part of the city, would give
a startling result. The Italians of Rieka are convinced
that their existence depends on good relations with the
Yugoslavs. They wish the town and port to be independent
under the sovereignty of the League of Nations.
This I have recently been told by a large number of
Italians in Rieka who are obliged, in public, to support
d'Annunzio." Signor Nitti must have been aware that
the voice of the C.N.I. was very far from being the
voice of Rieka. The C.N.I. had reasons of their own
for wishing to postpone the day when their arbitrary
powers would come to an end and a legal Government,
whether that of the League of Nations or of the people's
will or of Italy or of Yugoslavia, be established.</p>


<p class="section">SOME OF RIEKA'S SCANDALS</p>

<p>Owing to the complaints of innumerable citizens the
C.N.I. had nominated a Commission to inquire into the
pillage of the former Austrian stores at Rieka&mdash;this town,
as we have mentioned, had been the base for the Albanian
army&mdash;and the findings of that Commission displayed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>the culpability of the most prominent members of the
C.N.I. This document was for a long time unknown
to the general public, but was afterwards published in
Italy by Signor Riccardo Zanella, himself an Italian
and an ex-deputy and ex-mayor of Rieka. There was,
by the way, an article in the Triest paper, <i>Il Lavoratore</i>,
at the beginning of September 1920, wherein one Tercilio
Borghese, a former member of d'Annunzio's army,
confesses that on June 21, he was ordered by d'Annunzio,
as also by Colonel Sani and Captain Baldassari, to get
Signor Zanella in some way out of the world. Hinko
Camero and Angelo Marzi&#263;, his fellow-workers, had
likewise to be removed; and for this purpose Borghese
says that the Colonel provided him with a revolver.
He was also to try to seize any compromising documents.
But he was forced by his conscience to reveal everything
to Zanella.... Now this confession may be true or
false, but the Triest "fascisti" (Nationalists) believed in
it, for they issued a placard on which they called Borghese
a traitor and threatened him with death. "He who
after November 1918 returns to the martyred town,"
writes Signor Zanella, "is simply stupefied in beholding
that those personages who now strut on the political
scene, burning with the most ardent Italian patriotism,
are the same who until the eve of Vittorio Veneto were
the most unbending, the most eloquent and the most
devoted partisans and servants of the reactionary Magyar
r&eacute;gime." And around them a number of more or less
questionable persons were assembled, whose conduct with
regard to the disposal of the Austrian stores has now
been so severely censured. That organization which,
dependent on the C.N.I., was supposed to administer
the stores, was known as the Adriatic Commission. "We
all knew," said the Commission of inquiry, "that the
eyes of the whole world were gazing at our little town."
It was, therefore, very desirable that nothing irregular
should be done; whereas the judges give a most unfavourable
verdict. Nobody, they say, would rejoice more
than themselves if their conclusions should be shown to
be completely or partly erroneous, for they are all of
them penetrated with love for the fatherland Italy.
But they relate, with chapter and verse, a large number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of peculiar transactions which show that the goods were
very improperly and very hastily auctioned, and that
those who reaped the benefit were nearly always the
same people. To give one instance, some of the wine,
said to have been damaged, was sold at 260 crowns the
thousand litres, while undamaged wine brought 320
crowns, and the firm of Riboli, the only one which appeared
at the so-called auction, was only asked to pay 30 crowns.
Thus a considerable number of people in Rieka were
anxious that the town should not come under any
Government which might punish the culprits or make
them disgorge. And Nitti and d'Annunzio agreed with
these interested parties in opposing a solution other
than the overlordship of Italy. "The Yugoslavs should
understand," said the amiable Premier, "that Italy has
no intention of acting in a manner distasteful to them,
but is struggling for a national ideal." And meantime
what of the conditions in the poor distracted town?
"D'Annunzio," says an Italian paper, "is no longer
the master of Rieka. He has become the prisoner of
his own troops.... While he amuses himself and
organizes the worst orgies, his troops quarrel in the
streets and discharge their weapons.... A great many
of them have their mistresses in the hospital, where they
make themselves at home. When the doctors, after
some time, protested, the arditi, with bombs in their
hands, threatened to blow up the hospital if they were
not allowed to enter it." On the other hand the pale,
weary-looking poet succeeded in impressing on a special
correspondent of the <i>Morning Post</i> that he was "master
of his job." He told this gentleman&mdash;and was apparently
believed&mdash;that with the consent and approval of the
C.N.I. he had had the whole place mined, city and
harbour, and was prepared to blow it up at a moment's
notice. The means by which d'Annunzio, according to
his interviewer, worked on those who were depressed
with gazing at the empty shops, the silent warehouses,
the grass-grown wharves, so that the overwhelming
majority of the town supported him, was by simply
making to them an eloquent speech. D'Annunzio would
indeed be the master of his job if with some rounded
periods in Italian he could cause the very numerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
hostile business men to forget so blissfully that they
were men of business. Under his dispensation the town
is said to have been turned into a place of debauchery.
Accusations were brought against his sexual code, and
with regard to men of commerce: "those who are not
partisans of d'Annunzio are expelled, and their establishments
handed over to friends of the ruling power....
Woe to him who dares to condemn the transactions of
the poet's adherents. There and then he is pronounced
to be a Yugoslav, is placed under surveillance and is
persecuted." These Italian critics of the poet do not
in the least exaggerate. One instance of his conduct
towards a British firm will be sufficient. The "Anglo-Near
East Trading Company" shipped sixty-seven cases
(5292 pairs) of boots to private traders in Belgrade, and
on the way they reached Rieka just before d'Annunzio.
In March 1920 they were still detained there, and on the
13th of that month a certain Alcesde di Ambris, who
described himself as the Chief of the Cabinet, wrote a
letter saying that the boots were requisitioned, and that
they would be paid for within thirty days at a price
fixed on March 5 by experts of the local Chamber of
Commerce. The company was offered forty lire a pair,
but they declined to accept so inadequate a sum. Se&ntilde;or
Meynia, the Spanish Consul, who was also representing
Great Britain, attempted in various ways to help the
firm; he was finally told by an officer that the "exceptional
situation of Rieka compels the Authority to
suspend the exportation or transport of such goods as
are thoroughly needed here." And the Consul could do
no more than protest. One might presume, from this
officer's reply, that d'Annunzio required the boots for
his army. As a matter of fact, they were simply sold
to a couple of dealers, one Levy of Triest and Mail&auml;nder
of Rieka. It is alleged that the prices paid by these
receivers of stolen property was a good deal higher than
forty lire. When Signor di Ambris travelled to Rome
in the merry month of June and enjoyed a consultation
with the Prime Minister, who by this time was Signor
Giolitti, it was not in order to explain any such transactions
as that one of the boots, but for the purpose, we
are told, of offering the services of d'Annunzio and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
legionaries in Albania. The regular Italian army was
just then being roughly handled by the natives....
It may be that Signor di Ambris wanted guarantees
that if the d'Annunzian troops were to come to the
rescue, they would not suffer the fate of the Yugoslavs
who in the Great War had managed to desert to Italy,
had valiantly fought and won many decorations and&mdash;after
the War&mdash;been ignominiously interned. And they
had given no grounds for charges of financial frailty.</p>


<p class="section">PROGRESS OF THE YUGOSLAV IDEA</p>

<p>The months go by and Yugoslavia still survives. At
the post-office of a large village in Syrmia, not far from
Djakovo, where Bishop Strossmayer laboured during
fifty-five years for the union of the Southern Slavs which
he was destined not to see, a bulky farmer told me that
in his opinion Yugoslavia, created in 1918, was now in
1920 "kaput." He deduced this from the fact that a
telegram used to travel much more expeditiously in
Austrian days; but he did not remember that the Yugoslavs,
in the Serbian and in the Austro-Hungarian armies,
had suffered enormous losses in the War, and that while
French, Dutch and Swiss doctors have been obtained by
the Belgrade Government, one cannot use telegraphists
who are ignorant of the language. An excellent province
in which Yugoslavia's solidity can be studied is Bosnia.
At the outbreak of the War the Moslems and Croats
were not imbued with the Yugoslav idea; it seemed
to them that the Serbs, one of whom had slain the Archduke,
were traitors to Southern Slavdom. During the
War the Croats and Moslems were taught by their Slav
officers to be good nationalists and were given frequent
lessons in the art of going over to the enemy. After
the Armistice one did not see every Serb, Croat and
Moslem in Bosnia forthwith forgetting all the evil of the
past. Among the less enlightened certain private acts
of vengeance had to be performed; but these were not
as numerous as one might have expected. And very
soon the population of Bosnia came to be interested far
less in the old religious differences&mdash;the two deputies
Dr. D&#382;amonia and Professor Stanojevi&#263; smilingly remembered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the day when, as schoolboys at Sarajevo,
they had been persuaded by the Austrians to pull out
each other's hair for the reason that one was a Croat
and one was a Serb&mdash;and now it was the engrossing subject
of Agrarian Reform which claimed the attention
of Catholic, Orthodox and Moslem. This is not a religious
question, for while the landlords are mostly Muhammedan
begs about half the peasants are of the same religion;
and the negotiations have been marked by a notable
absence of passion. Most of the begs acknowledge that
the old r&eacute;gime was unprofitable, for with the peasant
paying one-third to one-fifth of his production to the
landlord the land only yielded, as compared with the
sandy districts of East Prussia, in the proportion of five
to twenty-two. Under the new order of things, with the
State in support of the "usurping" peasant&mdash;so that
there are said to be in Bosnia about a thousand peasants
who are millionaires (in crowns)&mdash;there is no longer any
dispute with regard to the "kmet" land, where the
peasants with hereditary rights have become the owners;
and with regard to the "begluk," which the beg used
to let to anyone he pleased, it is only a question as to
the degree of compensation. Thus, it is not among the
landowners and the peasants that one must look in
searching for an anti-national party. Bosnia contains
various iron works and coal mines, where profession is
made of Communism. But when the Prince-Regent was
about to come to pay his first official visit in 1920 to
Sarajevo the Governor received a communication from
the Communists of Zenica, which is on the railway line.
They asked for permission to salute "our Prince" as
he came past; and a deputation of these Communists,
who are very like their colleagues in other parts of Yugoslavia,
duly appeared and took part in a ceremony at
the station.</p>


<p class="section">DESPITE THE NEW PHENOMENON OF COMMUNISM</p>

<p>Just as innocuous&mdash;whatever the enemies of Yugoslavia
may say&mdash;are the Communists in the old kingdom
of Serbia. Perhaps in the whole State of Yugoslavia
they number 50,000 in a population of about 12,500,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
But they are so well organized that in the municipal
elections of 1920 they were victorious in most of the
towns. In Belgrade they secured 3600 votes, as compared
with 3200 for the Radicals, 2800 for the Democrats&mdash;both
of whom were not only badly organized but very
slack&mdash;and 605 for the Republicans. However, the
Communists refused to swear the requisite oath, and in
consequence were not permitted to take office, the Radicals
and Democrats forming a union to carry on. It was
agreed to have a new election and the other parties,
being now awakened, determined that the Communists
should not again top the poll. But in the provincial
towns they have not by any means shown themselves a
disintegrating influence. At Ni&#353;, for example, they conducted
the municipal affairs quite satisfactorily, while at
&#268;uprija they perceived that it would be impossible to
put into effect their entire programme, and so, after
fourteen days, they resigned.</p>


<p class="section">THE RISE AND FALL OF COMMUNISM IN <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'YUGLOSLAVIA'">YUGOSLAVIA</ins></p>

<p>... As for the Communists in the Skup&#353;tina, it
may be argued that though this party of over fifty members
has ceased to exist we should have said not simply that
they are innocuous but that they have been rendered so.
They were in principle against any State which violated
their somewhat hazy ideas on the subject of Capital:
while professing to aim at the holding of wealth in common
they secured a great deal of their success at the polls
through the bait of more land for the individual, which
they dangled before the eyes of the most ignorant classes.
Some of the electors who supported them were prosperous
farmers unable to resist the idea of a still larger farm;
but the majority of their adherents were as ignorant as
they were gullible. Yet one should remember that for
most of them this was practically their first experience
of an election: the constituencies which had formerly
been in Austria-Hungary had always seen the booths
under the supervision of the police, while the Macedonian
voter (three Communists were returned for Skoplje) had
only known the institutions of the Turkish Empire.
Being told by the Communists that their box at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
polling-station was really the box for the poor, the
Fukara, all the gypsies and so forth of Skoplje, who had
never voted in their lives, hastened to claim the privilege,
under the impression that a Communist Government
would liberate them from taxes and military service.
Other reasons for the success of the Communists in Yugoslavia,
an essentially non-industrial State, were the general
discontent with post-war conditions, and the virus which
so many of the voters had acquired in Russia or on the
Dobrudja front during the War. The activity in the
Skup&#353;tina of this very indigestible party&mdash;largely composed
of Turks, Magyars, Albanians, Germans and others&mdash;their
activity in and out of Parliament was not confined
to words. In June 1920 they only refrained from throwing
bombs in the Skup&#353;tina because one of their own
members would have been in peril, and in December a
plot against the Prince-Regent and some of the Ministers
was foiled. Thereupon the Emergency Act of December
27, the so-called Obznana, came into existence. It
suspended all Communist associations. This Act was
issued for the good of the country, but was not previously
presented to the Constituent Assembly or provided with
the royal signature. How justified were the authorities
in thus putting a stop to this party could be seen when
some of the Communist deputies were interrogated, for
either they were dangerous fanatics or else very ignorant
individuals, who knew no more about any other question
than about Communism, and had only been elected
because they professed dissatisfaction with things in
general. A few months later Mr. Dra&#353;kovi&#263;, the very
able Minister of the Interior, who had drawn up the
Obznana, but who by that time had laid down the seals
of office, was murdered by Communists at a seaside
resort in the presence of his wife and little children.
The object of this particular outrage was to persuade
the authorities in panic to withdraw the hated Obznana,
whereas the previous attempts on various personages
seem to have been greatly due to the desire to show
some positive result in return for the cash which came
to them from Moscow. (One of the leaders of the party,
the ex-professor of mathematics, was arrested last summer
in Vienna on his return from Moscow, with a large and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
very miscellaneous collection of English, French, American,
Russian and other money.) After the murder of Mr.
Dra&#353;kovi&#263; the mandates of the Communist deputies
were suppressed; seven or eight of them were detained,
for speedy trial, and the rest were told to go to their
homes. The Communist parliamentary party was at an
end&mdash;it was established that their Committee room in
the Skup&#353;tina had been used for highly improper purposes&mdash;but
there was nothing to prevent these ex-deputies
from being elected as members of any other party, and
it was rather beside the mark for an English review, the
<i>Labour Monthly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to talk of the "White Terror in Jugo-Slavia,"
as if there prevailed in that country anything
comparable with Admiral Horthy's r&eacute;gime in Hungary.</p>


<p class="section">OTHER LIONS IN THE PATH</p>

<p>The behaviour of the Communists was far from being
the only clog in Yugoslavia's parliamentary machine.
After the first General Election of November 1920&mdash;delayed
until then on account of Italy's attitude, which
made it impossible to demobilize the army&mdash;no single
party nor even one of the large groups was possessed of a
real working majority. Fierce and determined was the
Opposition;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to carry on the business of government
it became necessary to secure the coalition of several
parties. The Radical and Democrat <i>bloc</i> had to attract
to its side one or two other parties, and it was truly
difficult to make concessions to anyone of these without
rousing the righteous or the envious wrath of another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>group. In principle it was proper that the Bosnian
Moslems should receive compensation for their estates;
the question is whether the very large sum was less in
the nature of a fair price than of a bribe. The Radical
party was no longer under its happy triumvirate of
Pa&#353;i&#263;, the old diplomat, Proti&#263;, the executor of his ideas,
and Patcho&ugrave;, a medical man from Novi Sad, the real
brain of the party. We shall give an example of
Patcho&ugrave;'s prudence; the long views which he possessed
may be illustrated by what occurred at a meeting of
Radical deputies two days before the outbreak of the
second Balkan War. The Tzar's proposed arbitration
was being discussed and certain deputies, such as the late
Dr. Pavlovi&#263;, who was the first speaker of the Yugoslav
Parliament after the Great War, raised their voices in
opposition; they were supported by the army. "Can we
have Bitolje (Monastir)?" they asked. "It is not known
what the Tzar will decide," said Pa&#353;i&#263;. "Then we can't
accept arbitration," said Pavlovi&#263;. And Patcho&ugrave; spoke.
"I would be very glad to know," said he, "what Mr.
Pavlovi&#263; would say if we could get, by possibly now
sacrificing Bitolje, not only Bosnia, but Dalmatia and
other Slav countries." "All that," said Pavlovi&#263;, "is
music of the future." "For you perhaps," said Patcho&ugrave;,
"but not for us." And the vote in favour of arbitration
was carried. Patcho&ugrave; died in 1915 at Ni&#353;. Besides
being an expert in finance and foreign affairs he was less
arbitrary in his methods than Proti&#263;. That very erudite
man&mdash;no sooner does an important book appear in Western
or Central Europe than a copy of it goes to his library&mdash;has
not been much endowed with patience. This brought
him into conflict with his Democratic colleague Mr.
Pribi&#269;evi&#263;, the most prominent man in that party. It
would have been well if Dr. Davidovi&#263;, the gentle, tactful
leader of the party, could have taken into his own composition
one-half of his lieutenant's excessive combativeness.
Pribi&#269;evi&#263; and Proti&#263; find it impossible to work
together, and we can sympathize with both of them.
One day at a more than usually disagreeable Cabinet
meeting Pribi&#269;evi&#263; reminded the then Prime Minister
that he was the first among equals, a point of view which
did not square with the methods of Proti&#263;, who gives his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
support to those Ministers who bend before him. And as
Pribi&#269;evi&#263; has hitherto insisted on being in every Cabinet,
Proti&#263; has withdrawn and has started a newspaper, the
<i>Radical</i>, in which he attacks him with great violence
and ability. One charge which he brings against this
Serb from Croatia is perfectly true, for he has succeeded
in alienating the Croats. Only two or three Democrat
deputies come from Croatia, and they are elected by the
Serbs who live in that province. It would seem that the
Croats will remain in more or less active opposition so
long as Pribi&#269;evi&#263;, the arch-centralizer who scorns to
wear the velvet glove, stays in the Government. There
is also much doubt as to whether Proti&#263; can break down
their particularism, which, of course, is not an anti-national
movement. But luckily, through other men,
it will be stayed. For other reasons one regrets that
Mr. Proti&#263; is not now in power; as the Finance Minister
he knew how to introduce order, preferring the interests
of the State to those of his party. Both Radicals and
Democrats have been reluctant, for electoral purposes,
to tax the farmer; and Mr. Proti&#263; would probably have
the courage to impose a direct tax, as the Radicals did,
without losing popular favour, in the old days. In this
respect and concerning the numerous posts that have been
created for party reasons it is thought that Mr. Pa&#353;i&#263;
has not displayed sufficient energy.</p>

<p>There was in Yugoslavia a heavy war deficit, both
economic and financial. Communications were out of
order and the State, owing to the adverse exchange
(which was not justified by the economic potentialities
of the country, but was probably caused by the unsettled
conditions both internal and external), the State could
not obtain the necessary raw products for industrial
undertakings such as iron-works, tanneries, cloth factories,
etc. The Yugoslavs did not borrow from abroad, as
they might have done, in the form of raw materials.
The agricultural products which were exported should
have been sold for the needful manufacturers' material
and not for articles of luxury and not for depreciated
foreign, especially Austrian, currency.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The Yugoslav
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>public is slow to learn economy, that it should restrict
the importation of luxuries. What makes it particularly
unhappy, in which frame of mind it listens to the voices
prophesying woe for Yugoslavia, is the knowledge that
for increased production and for many other necessary
aims more capital is wanted, whereas under present
conditions it has been difficult to borrow. But happily in
this respect the corner has been turned, and in the spring
of 1922 a considerable loan was negotiated with an
American syndicate.</p>


<p class="section">THE NADIR OF DEVINE AND NIKITA</p>

<p>However, the principal disintegrating force in Yugoslavia,
we were often told in England, was Montenegro,
where, it seems, the natives were yearning to cast off
their yoke. The British devotees of the former king
told us of the ghastly state of Montenegro, and our
Foreign Office was bombarded with reports which ascribed
these evils to the wretched Government of Yugoslavia.
"There is nothing anywhere," says a memorandum from
the ineffable Devine. "The shops are empty, the town
markets are deserted. The peasants, who may not travel
from one village to another without a Serbian 'permit'
... etc. etc." Well, I visited Cetinje market on a non-market
day, and passing through the crowd of people
I admired the produce of various parts of the country&mdash;melons,
tomatoes, dried fish, onions, peaches, nuts and
cheese, lemons from Antivari and so forth. I happened
to ask a comely woman called Petrie&#269;evi&#263; from near
Podgorica whether she had a permit; she looked surprised
at such a question. It is very true that the more mountainous
parts of Montenegro are far from prosperous,
but to insinuate that this is the fault of the Government
is childish. Hampered by the lack of transport&mdash;practically
everything has to be brought on ox-carts up by the
tremendous road from Kotor&mdash;they have recently given
away 38,000 kilos of wheat and many mountain horses
at Cetinje. I suppose it was all in the game for Devine
and his assistants to throw mud at the Yugoslav Government
if they believed that they would&mdash;for the happiness
of the Montenegrins and themselves&mdash;help to restore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Nikita. But what was the use of saying that "the poor
people have no money and have nothing to eat; they
are said to be living on a herb of some sort that grows
wild in the mountains"?... A very satisfactory feature
of the past year has been the migration of 7000 Montenegrins
to more fertile parts of Yugoslavia. And as for
Nikita's partisans, they were such small beer that when
they wished to hold a meeting at Cetinje the Government
had not the least objection; it also allowed them to sing
the songs that Nikita wrote, but that was more than the
population of Cetinje would stand. It is only at Cetinje,
where he reigned for sixty years, and at Njegu&#353;, where
he was born, that Nikita has any adherents at all. As for
his adherents at Gaeta, the Cetinje authorities were
perfectly willing to give a passport to any woman who
desired to spend some time in Italy with her husband
or brother or son. She might stay there or come back,
just as she pleased. And very likely when she got to
Gaeta she would relate how in the cathedral, at the rock-bound
monastery of Ostrog, and in other sacred places,
one could see the Montenegrin women cursing their ex-king.</p>


<p class="section">A GENERAL</p>

<p>The sinister shadow of d'Annunzio had fallen across
Dalmatia and beyond it: for instance, on November 20,
1919, the King of Italy's name-day, a general holiday
was proclaimed in the occupied districts. The director
of the school at Zlosela, a Slav who had never been an
Italian subject, gave&mdash;perhaps injudiciously&mdash;the usual
lessons. He and his wife were arrested and for months
they were in prison, their six-months-old child being left
to the mercy of neighbours; and the local commandant,
Major Gracco Golini, told Dr. Smol&#269;i&#263;, the President of
the National Council, that the slightest action on the
part of the Yugoslavs would provoke terrible measures
on the part of d'Annunzio's arditi, who would spare
neither women nor children.... The reader may remember
the Montenegrin General Ve&#353;ovi&#263;, who took to
the mountains and defied the Austrians. On the accession
of the Emperor Karl he surrendered and, much to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
surprise of his people, he travelled round the country
recommending every one to offer no more opposition, to
be quiet and obedient to the Austrians. When the war
was over the authorities at Belgrade gave him, as they
did to other Montenegrin generals, the same rank in the
Yugoslav army; but the numerous Montenegrins who
resented his unpatriotic behaviour persuaded the War
Office, after two or three months, to remove him from the
active list. This exasperated the ambitious man to
such an extent that he withdrew to his own district and
began to work against Yugoslavia. A major with a
force of 200 gendarmes was sent to fetch him back and,
after conversations that lasted ten days, induced him to
return to Belgrade. There he was not molested; he used
to sit for hours in the large caf&eacute; of the Hotel Moscow in
civilian clothes. But one day a policeman at the harbour
happened to observe him talking for a long time to a
fisherman; he wondered what the two might have in
common. When the fisherman was interrogated he
refused at first to give any information, but he finally
divulged that he had agreed, for 1500 francs, to take the
General down the Danube either to Bulgaria or Roumania.
That evening at nine o'clock the General appeared, with
his son and a servant; he was captured,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and among his
documents were some which proved, it was alleged, that
he was in communication with d'Annunzio.</p>


<p class="section">TWO COMIC PRO-ITALIANS IN OUR MIDST</p>

<p>Month follows month. The reading public and some
of the statesmen of the world begin to recognize that,
whatever may be the case on other portions of the new
map, there is nothing unreal or impossible or artificial
about Yugoslavia. This State is the result of a national
movement, having its origins within and not without
the peoples whose destiny it affects. The various Yugoslavs,
after being kept apart for all these centuries, have
now&mdash;roughly speaking&mdash;come to that stage which the
Germans reached in 1866. They cannot rest until they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>reach the unity which came to the Germans after 1870.
And here also, it seems, the unity will not be gained
without the sacrifice of thousands of young men. "Go,
my son," said Oxenstiern the Swedish Chancellor, "and
observe by what imbeciles the world is governed." It
is pitiable that the leaders of the nations, in declining
month after month to give to Yugoslavia an equitable
frontier, should apparently have been more impressed
by the arguments of Mrs. Lucy Re-Bartlett<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> than by
those of an anonymous philosopher in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> "Nationality?" says the lady, speaking of
the country people of Dalmatia, "nationality? These
people of the country districts&mdash;the great mass of the
population&mdash;are far too primitive to have any sense of
nationality as yet, but if some day they call themselves
Italian...." That is what she says of a people which
through centuries of persecution and neglect have preserved
their language, their traditions, their hopes; a
people which, more than forty years ago, won their great
victory against the Habsburg r&eacute;gime of Italian and
Italianist officials, so that with one exception every mayor
in Dalmatia and all the Imperial deputies and hundreds
of societies of all kinds, such as 375 rural savings-banks,
were exclusively Yugoslav. Out of nearly 150,000 votes
at the last general election, which was held in 1911 on the
basis of universal suffrage, the Yugoslav candidates
received about 145,000 against 5000 to 6000 for the
Italians. It is indisputable that the Dalmatian peasants
are backward in many things, but one is really sorry for
the person who declares in print that they possess no
sense of nationality. Let her visit any house of theirs on
Christmas Eve and watch them celebrate the "badnjak";
let her listen any evening to their songs. Let her think
whether there is no sense of nationality among the priests,
who almost to a man are the sons of Yugoslav peasants.
And let her recollect that these are the days when the
other Yugoslavs are at last uniting in their own free
State. She has the hardihood to tell us of the poor
Dalmatians who were being bribed with waterworks and
bridges and gratuitous doctoring. I daresay that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>little ragged Slav children of Kievo whom she saw clustering
round the kindly Italian officer were glad enough to
eat his chocolates,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but I think that we others should pay
more attention to those secret societies, the <i>&#269;etasis</i> (which
is Slav for komitadjis), who have sworn to liberate all
Istria from the Italians. We may also consider the
proposals made by the Southern Slavs whom Signor
Salvemini, the distinguished Professor of Modern History
at Pisa, called "extreme Nationalists" (see his letter
of September 11, 1916, to the editor of <i>La Serbie</i>, which
was being published in Switzerland). Well, it appears
that the "extreme Southern Slav Nationalists," as the
utmost of their aspirations, claim the Southern Slav
section of the province of Gorica with the town Triest
and the whole of Istria, that is to say, a territory which,
with a population the majority of whom are Slav, contains
also 284,325 Italians, whereas the smallest programme
ever proposed by moderate Italians, including
Professor Salvemini, covets some 364,000 Southern Slavs.
Thus the extreme Southern Slav elements, in their widest
demands, are more moderate than the moderate Italians
in their most limited programme. "Without distinction
of tribe or creed," says that Edinburgh reviewer, "all
the Yugoslavs are waiting for their 1870. This will fix
and perpetuate their unity.... The preparation is
going forward silently&mdash;almost sullenly&mdash;and without
demur or qualification the Yugoslavs are accepting the
Serb military chiefs' guidance and domination." He
was much impressed by the silence and controlled power
of the Serbian General Staff. There was in Europe a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>general war-weariness; but not in Yugoslavia. There
was a hush in this part of Europe, broken only by the shrill
screams of Italian propagandists and outbursts of suppressed
passion on the other side.</p>


<p class="section">THE BELATED TREATY OF RAPALLO</p>

<p>And the Rapallo Treaty of November 1920, when at
last the statesmen of Italy and Yugoslavia came to
terms regarding all their frontiers! This Treaty was
received with much applause by the great majority of
the French and British Press; in this country of compromise
it was pointed out by many that as each party
knew that the other had abated something of his desires
the Treaty would probably remain in operation for a
long time to come. And column after column of smug
comment was written in various newspapers by the
"Diplomatic Correspondent," whose knowledge of diplomacy
may have been greater than his acquaintance with
the Adriatic, since they followed one another, like a
procession of sheep, in copying the mistake in a telegram
which spoke of Eritto, the curious suburb of Zadar,
instead of Borgo Erizzo. They noted that each side had
yielded something, though it was true that the Yugoslavs
had been the more generous in surrendering half a million
of their compatriots, whereas the Italians had given up
Dalmatia, to which they never had any right.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> "The claim
for Dalmatia was entirely unjustified," said Signor
Colajanni in the Italian Chamber on November 23&mdash;yet
it was not our business to weigh the profit and loss
to the two interested parties. After all, it was they who
had between themselves made this Agreement, and one
might argue that it surely would be an impertinence if
anybody else was more royalist than the king. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>commentators held that it was inexpedient for anyone
to ask why the Yugoslavs should now have accepted
conditions that were, on the whole, considerably worse
than those which President Wilson, with the approval
of Great Britain and France, had laid down as a minimum,
if they were to realize their national unity. And, of
course, these writers deprecated any reference to the
pressure which France and Great Britain brought to
bear upon the Yugoslavs when the negotiations at Rapallo
were in danger of falling through. If we take two Scottish
newspapers, the <i>Scotsman</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> was typical of this very
bland attitude; it congratulated everyone on the
harmonious close to a long, intricate and frequently
dangerous controversy. The <i>Glasgow Herald</i>,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> on the
other hand, was one of the few newspapers which took a
more than superficial view. "Monstrous," it said, "as
such intervention seems, no student of the Adriatic White
Paper&mdash;as lamentable a collection of documents as British
diplomacy has to show&mdash;can deny its possibility, nay its
probability. It is precisely the same game as was nearly
successful in January 1920 and again in April 1920, but
both times was frustrated by Wilson. We are entitled
to ask, for the honour of our nation, if it has been played
again; indeed if the whole mask of direct negotiation&mdash;a
British suggestion&mdash;was not devised at San Remo
with the express purpose of making the game succeed.
If it be so&mdash;and if it is not so it is imperative that we
are given frankly the full story of British policy in the
Adriatic, for instance the dispatches so carefully omitted
from the White Paper&mdash;then our forebodings for the future
are more than justified.... It is emphatically a bad
settlement."</p>

<p>"We shall not establish friendly and normal relations
with our neighbour Italy unless we reduce all causes of
friction to a minimum," said M. Vesni&#263;, the Yugoslav
Prime Minister, who during his long tenure of the Paris
Legation was an active member of the Acad&eacute;mie des
Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and other learned societies;
he excelled in getting at the root of the worst difficulties
in international law, and he was particularly admired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>for his ability to combine legal and historic knowledge.
Because he studied history minutely&mdash;with a special
fondness for Gambetta who, racially an Italian, had something
of the generous and sacred fervour that distinguished
the leaders of the Risorgimento&mdash;M. Vesni&#263; could not
bring himself to hate Italy, despite all that d'Annunzio
and other Imperialists had made his countrymen suffer.
"Neither the Government nor the elected representatives
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes," said he courageously
in his first speech as Prime Minister, "ought
to look upon Italy as an enemy country. We have
to settle important and difficult questions with Italy....
We must reduce all causes of friction to a
minimum."</p>

<p>The Treaty of Rapallo gives Zadar to Italy, because
in that little town there is an Italian majority; but
central and eastern Istria, with their overwhelming Slav
majority, are not given to the Yugoslavs&mdash;a fact which
Professor Salvemini deplored in the Roman Chamber.
By the Treaty of Rapallo Rieka is given independence,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
but with Italy in possession of Istria and the isle of Cres,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>she can at any moment choke the unprotected port,
having very much the same grip of that place as Holland
has for so long had of Antwerp; and the sole concession
on Italy's part seems to be that in the south she gives
up the large Slav islands of Hvar, Kor&#269;ula and Vis, and
only appropriates the small one of Lastovo.... "It
has cost Italy a pang," says Mr. George Trevelyan,
"to consent, after victory, to leave the devoted and
enthusiastic Italians of the Dalmatian coast towns (other
than Zara) in foreign territory." The truth is that
henceforward Yugoslavia will contain some 5000 Italians
(many of whom are Italianized Slavs), as against not less
than 600,000 Slavs in Italy. And while the former are
but tiny groups in towns which even under Venetian
rule were predominantly Slav and are surrounded on all
sides by purely Slav populations, the latter live for the
most part in compact masses and include roughly one-third
of the whole Slovene race, whose national sense is
not only very acute, but who are also much less illiterate
than their Italian neighbours. One cannot be astonished
if the Slovenes think of this more than of Giotto, Leonardo,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Galileo and Dante. But one may be a little surprised
that such a man as Mr. Edmund Gardner should allow
his reverence for the imperishable glories of Italy to
becloud his view of the modern world. It is certainly a
fact that the Slovenes are to-day less illiterate than the
Italians, but because Dr. Seton-Watson alludes to this,
Mr. Gardner (in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, of February
13, 1921) deplores the "Balkanic mentality that
seems to afflict some Englishmen when dealing with these
problems."</p>


<p class="section">ITS PROBABLE FRUITS</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that the Treaty of Rapallo has placed
between the Yugoslavs and the Italians all too many
causes of friction. Zadar, like other such enclaves, will
be dear to the heart of the smuggler. She cannot live
without her Yugoslav hinterland&mdash;five miles away in
Yugoslavia are the waterworks, and if these were not
included, by a special arrangement, in her dominion,
she would have no other liquid but her maraschino. She
cannot die without her Yugoslav hinterland&mdash;but so that
her inhabitants need not be carried out into a foreign
land, the cemetery has also, by stretching a point, been
included in the city boundaries. It remains to be seen
how Zadar and the hinterland will serve two masters.
We have alluded to the questionable arrangements at
Rieka, in which town there had for those years
been such an orgy of limelight and recrimination that
even the most statesmanlike solution must have left a
good deal of potential friction. In Istria the dangers
of an outbreak are evident. Italy has now become the
absolute mistress of the Adriatic and has gained a
strategical frontier which could hardly be improved upon,
while Yugoslavia has been placed in an economic position
of much difficulty. Sooner or later, if matters are left
<i>in situ</i>, trouble will arise. Perhaps an economic treaty
between Italy and Yugoslavia, as favourable as possible
to the weaker State, would introduce some sort of stability;
but no good cause would be served by crying "Peace"
where there is no peace, and while Yugoslavia has a
grievance there will be trouble in the Balkans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The most serious phase of the Adriatic crisis is now
ushered in, for a new Alsace has been created; and those
who point this out cannot be charged with an excessive
leaning towards the Yugoslavs. It also seems to me that
one can scarcely say they are alarmists. If Yugoslavia,
in defiance of that most immoral pressure, had declared
for war, Vesni&#263; at the general election would have swept
the country with the cry of "War for Istria!" To his
eternal honour he chose the harder path of loyalty to the
new ideas which Serbian blood has shed so freely to
make victorious. A momentary victory has now been
gained by the Italians, but not one that makes for peace.
It poisons by annexations fundamentally unjustifiable,
however consecrated by treaty, the whole source of
tranquillity in the Near East. "Paciencia!" [Have
patience] you say, in refusing to give alms to a Portuguese
beggar, and he follows your advice. But when the
Yugoslavs ask for a revision of the Treaty&mdash;if the Italians
do not wisely offer it themselves&mdash;it would be rash if in
attempting to foretell the future we should base ourselves
upon the premise that their patience will be everlasting.
A new Alsace has been created, an Alsace to which, in
the opinion of competent observers, all the Yugoslavs
will turn until the day comes when it is honourable to
set the standards forth on a campaign of liberation.</p>


<p class="section">NEW FORCES IN THE FIRST YUGOSLAV PARLIAMENT</p>

<p>When the Yugoslavs were at last in a position, late
in 1920, to hold the elections for the Constituent Assembly
the Radicals and the Democrats were the most successful,
but even if they made a Coalition they would still have
no majority. [Now and then the Democrats asserted
themselves against the Radicals, but when the Opposition
thought they could perceive a rift the Democratic Press
would write that the two parties were most intimately
joined to one another, and especially the Democrats.]
The small parties were very numerous, the smallest being
that of M. Ribarac, the old Liberal leader, who found
himself in the Skup&#353;tina with nobody to lead; the
clericals of Slovenia came to grief, a fact which appeared
to give general satisfaction, and a similar mishap befell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the decentralizing parties of Croatia. On the other hand
the Croat Peasants' party, whose decentralization ideas
were more extreme, had a very considerable success,
and the Communist party, whose fall we have already
described, had come to the Skup&#353;tina with some fifty
members.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>a</i>) MARKOVI&#262; THE COMMUNIST</p>

<p>The temporary triumph of the Communists was admittedly
due to the exceptional position in which the country
found itself. They had in Sima Markovi&#263; an enthusiastic
leader who has abandoned the teaching of mathematics
in order to expound the gospel of Moscow, and in the
Skup&#353;tina the shrill, voice of this kindly, bald-headed
little man had to be raised to its uttermost capacity, for
most of his fellow-members were unwilling to be taught.
It so happens that he is Pa&#353;i&#263;'s godson, and on one occasion
when the little Communist was talking with great vehemence
the old gentleman, who was turning over the
pages of some document, was heard by an appreciative
House to murmur: "Oh, be still, my child, be still!"
But the most unfortunate episode in Markovi&#263;'s oratory
was when he expressed the hope that Communism would
rage through the country like an epidemic, forgetting for
the moment that those municipalities which had gone
over to Communism had won general praise for their
improvements in the sanitary sphere. Largely on account
of this infelicitous simile he was replaced in the leadership
by another, a less vigorous and less entertaining
person. And this party stood in particular need of
attractive champions.</p>

<p>The Croat Peasants' party, or the Radi&#263; party, as it
came to be called, gave to its beloved chief more than
half the seats in Croatia, forty-nine out of ninety-three;
and the whole party refused to go to Belgrade.</p>

<p>"Would it not have been better," I asked him, "if
you had gone? The Constitution will be settled without
you."</p>


<p class="section">(<i>b</i>) RADI&#262;, THE MUCH-DISCUSSED</p>

<p>"We had various reasons," said he, "for not going.
One of them was that the Assembly which laid down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Constitution was not sovereign. For example, it was
not permitted to discuss whether Yugoslavia should be
a monarchy or a republic. I admit that three-quarters
of the members would very likely have voted for a
monarchy, and in that case we should have accepted
the situation very much as do the royalist deputies in
the French Parliament."</p>

<p>"What are your own views on this subject?"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "for this period of transition I
believe&mdash;mark you, this only applies to myself&mdash;that a
monarchy is not merely acceptable but preferable. On
the other hand the Croat peasant was so badly treated
by the Habsburgs that he will now hear of nothing but
a republic."</p>

<p>I ventured to say that this sudden conversion to
republican ideas in one who for centuries had lived in a
monarchy was peculiar, and Radi&#263; acknowledged that
when the first republican cries were raised at a meeting
of the Peasants' party on July 25, 1918 they came to him
as a revelation, one which he accepted.</p>

<p>"You don't accept everything that your peasants
shout for?"</p>

<p>"I do not," said he. "There was a gentleman who
asked them at a meeting whether they would kill him if
he, elected as their representative, were to go to Belgrade.
They shouted back that they would do so. And when
the prospective candidate came to tell me this story,
thinking that I would be delighted, I told him that a
ship's captain cannot have his hands bound before undertaking
a voyage and he must therefore withdraw his
candidature.... When the time comes we will go to
Belgrade."</p>

<p>"And those who say that you are longing for the
return of the Habsburgs?"</p>

<p>He gripped my arm. "They are fools," said he.
"We are looking forward as eagerly as the great Bishop
Strossmayer to the union of the Southern Slavs. According
to the spirit of his time he began at the top, with
academies, picture galleries and so forth. We prefer
to begin with elementary schools." And bubbling with
enthusiasm he told me of the efforts his party was making.
It was plain to see that what lies nearest to his heart is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to improve their social and economic status. And those
observers are probably in the right, who believe that he
merely uses this republican cry as a weapon which he
will conveniently drop when it has served its purpose.</p>

<p>"If only Yugoslavia had a great statesman," said I,
"who would weld the new State together, so that the
Croats remain with the Serbs not alone for the reasons
that they are both Southern Slavs and that they are
surrounded by not over-friendly neighbours. The great
statesman&mdash;perhaps it will be Pa&#353;i&#263;&mdash;will make you all
happy to come together."</p>

<p>"From the bottom of my heart I hope he will succeed,"
said Radi&#263;, "and he will be remembered as our second
and more fortunate Strossmayer."</p>

<p>We generally imagine that the statesmen of South-Eastern
Europe are a collection of rather swarthy, frock-coated
personages who, when not engaged in decrying
each other, are very busily occupied in feathering their
own nests. If any one of them, at the outset of his
career, had a sense of humour we suppose that in this
heated atmosphere it must have long ago evaporated.
But strangely enough, the two most prominent politicians
in Yugoslavia, the venerable Pa&#353;i&#263;, the Prime Minister
of this new State of Serbs and Croats and Slovenes, even
as he used for years to be the autocrat of Serbia, and his
opponent Stephen Radi&#263; are, both of them, by the grace
of God, of a humorous disposition. Outwardly, there
is not much resemblance between them: Pa&#353;i&#263;, the
picture of a benevolent patriarch, letting fall in his
deep voice a few casual words which bring down his
critics' case, hopelessly down like a wounded aeroplane,
and Radi&#263; the fervid little orator, the learned man, whose
life has been devoted to the Croat peasants and who is
said to find it difficult to make a speech that is under
eight hours in length. Last year when the vigorous
Pribi&#269;evi&#263;, then Minister of the Interior, who is determined
to compel the Serbs and the Croats straightway
to live in the closest companionship, whereas Radi&#263;,
supported by most of the Croat <i>intelligentsia</i>, argues
that in view of their very different culture, the Serbs
having enjoyed a Byzantine and the Croats an Austrian
education, it would be advisable for these two branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of the South Slav nation to come gradually and not
violently together,&mdash;last year when Radi&#263; was lying in
prison on account of his subversive ideas Pribi&#269;evi&#263; sent
a message to say that he was prepared to adopt half
his programme. And Radi&#263; sent back word regretting
that the Minister could not adopt the whole of it and thus
obtain for himself the Peasants' party. It is wrong to
assert that this party is unpatriotic; the enemies of
Yugoslavia, who welcome in Radi&#263; a disruptive element,
are totally in error. Years ago he was working for the
eventual union of Serbs and Croats&mdash;the Austrians
imprisoned him because in 1903 he went to Belgrade
at the accession of King Peter and made an admirable
speech to this effect&mdash;and his present attitude is due to
the impatient manner in which Mr. Pribi&#269;evi&#263; and his
friends are endeavouring to bring the union about. His
peasants are a conservative people; they cannot instantly
dispel the anti-Serb ideas which the Austrians for ever
inculcated, nor the negative anti-Serb frame of mind
which they learned from their own <i>intelligentsia</i>. It
will take a little time before the Catholic peasant realizes
that the Orthodox Serb is his brother and that now his
military service will not be in an alien army, but in his
own. "Let us go slowly," says Radi&#263;, "with our peasants";
and he knows them very well.... One is told that he
changes his opinions from hour to hour; he is certainly
very impetuous, very much under the influence of his
emotions; but in one thing he has never varied&mdash;he
has always struggled for the Croat peasant, and he has
been rewarded by the unbounded devotion of that faithful,
rather incoherent, creature.</p>

<p>Now the Serbs are a democratic people; they are by
their nature in opposition to any force, civil or military,
which might attempt to make the monarchy more absolute.
The wisest Serbs do not forget that in the peasant
lies their principal wealth, and although as yet the
Serbian Peasants' party does not hold many constituencies
in the old kingdom, nevertheless it appears to have
a brighter prospect than any other Serbian party, for in
that country the revolt against the lawyer-politician is
likely to be more efficacious than in France or England.
One may look forward to an understanding between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Radi&#263; and this Serbian party, which is only two or three
years old, although its founder, the excellent Avramovi&#263;&mdash;an
elderly gentleman who sits behind vast barricades
of books in various languages&mdash;has devoted himself
for many years to agrarian co-operative societies, of
which in Serbia there are more than 1500.</p>

<p>The most uncertain factors seem to be the moderating
hold of Radi&#263; over his peasants and over himself. No one
doubts but that he has the interests of the peasant very
much at heart, and if he succeeds in improving the
peasant's lot then that grateful giant will presumably not
sink again into the sleep which he enjoyed when he was
under the Habsburgs. The circulation of Radi&#263;'s weekly
paper <i>Dom</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> ("The Home") has risen from 2000 before the
elections and 9000 during the elections to 30,000. One
enterprising vendor, a Serb from the Banat, takes 500
copies a week and tramps over the countryside, disposing
of his wares either for cash or for eggs, the latter of
which he sells at the end of the week to a Zagreb hotel.
The peasant is making great efforts to raise himself&mdash;a
case has recently been brought to light of a farmer in
Zagorija who, as a hobby, has taught more than 700
persons to read and write. The peasant perceives that
he has been assisted far less by the Catholic Church than
by the work of Radi&#263;. It is not unfair to say that the
Church desired, above all things, to keep the peasant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>under her control. If a parish priest was disliked by his
flock, so a prominent Croatian priest tells me, that was
all the more reason why the Bishop refused to remove
him. And the clergy, except for an enlightened minority,
have been very much opposed to Radi&#263;'s policy of
democratizing the Church.... In return for his unceasing
labours he has now secured the peasant's love
and confidence. He will retain them if he satisfies his
client, and it seems to be within his power&mdash;gaining
for him a better position and dissuading him from fantastic
demands. He can be of immense assistance in the task
of building up the State. But will the brilliant flame
within him burn with steadiness? Has he got sufficient
strength of will? With all his qualities of heart and
brain he has not managed to discard his zig-zag impetuosity.
The peasants, who recognize his talents, ask him
to captain the ship; but he runs down too often into his
cabin and leaves the unskilled sailors on the bridge.
Down in the cabin he is feverishly and with great skill
writing a contradiction of a pronouncement he made
yesterday.</p>

<p>Those who are openly sailing in Radi&#263;'s boat are for
the most part the hard-headed peasants. Yet a number
of the <i>intelligentsia</i> are coming on board&mdash;some of them,
no doubt, with a view to their own advancement, but
others on account of their convictions. And a still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>greater number of the Croat <i>intelligentsia</i> look on him
with sympathy&mdash;municipal officials, barristers, doctors,
merchants, schoolmasters and military officers. It is
most foolish to pretend that all these people are thinking
regretfully of the old Habsburg days&mdash;they are, in the
vast majority, sincere and loyal Yugoslavs who have
certain grievances. They do not believe that Croatia has
fared very well since the institution of the new State
and it would seem wise to give them as much autonomy
as is consonant with the interests of the whole country,
for then they will only have themselves to blame if there
is no improvement. Maybe they are unduly sensitive,
but they were for many years in political warfare with
the Magyars and this should be taken into consideration.
Even if all the grievances are based on misconceptions,
on the difficulties of the moment, on the circumstances
of the fading past&mdash;the new generation of Croats, say
their teachers, are growing up to be excellent Yugoslavs&mdash;yet
an effort should be made to sweep them away.</p>

<p>When Belgrade makes a statesmanlike gesture then
Radi&#263; will probably be able to persuade the peasants
to abandon their republican slogan&mdash;both they and the
<i>intelligentsia</i> will abandon their reserved attitude towards
the Government which they were far from entertaining
when the State was first established. It seems as if the
role of conciliator may well be filled by that wise old
man, Nicholas Pa&#353;i&#263;, who is now no longer a mere Balkan
Premier. When he was that he very properly used
Balkan methods, despite the stern remarks of a few
Western critics.</p>


<p class="section">THE SERBS AND THE CROATS</p>

<p>We have alluded to the relations between Serbs and
Croats. This is a subject of such importance that it
will be well to consider it more fully. When Yugoslavia
sprang into existence at the end of the War&mdash;70 per cent.
of this State having previously been under the rule of
the House of Habsburg&mdash;it was met in various quarters
with a grudging welcome. Soon, we were told, it would
dissolve again, and every symptom of internal discontent
was treated as a proof of this. On the other hand there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
were those who told us that the Southern Slavs, having
come together after all these hundreds of years, were
tightly clasped in each others' arms and that all reports
to the contrary came from very interested parties.</p>

<p>Little was said of the Slovenes; their language, as
we have mentioned, is not the same as that spoken
by Serbs and Croats, and&mdash;what is of still greater importance&mdash;they
have Slovenia to themselves. If Croatia
were equally immune from Serbs, then by this time the
Southern Slavs would be a more united nation. Those
people were wrong who fancied that the presence of the
Serbs in Croatia&mdash;they form between one-fourth and one-third
of the population&mdash;would be of service in welding
together the new State. They forgot that for many
years the Austro-Hungarian Government had in Croatia
played off the Roman Catholic Croats against the
Orthodox Serbs. The two Slav brothers were incited
to mutual hatred, and though such a propaganda would
naturally have more effect among the uneducated classes,
yet all too often the <i>intelligentsia</i> responded to these
machinations. More favour, of course, was shown to
the Croats, whose obedience could largely be secured by
means of the Church, whereas no similar pressure could
be brought to bear upon the Orthodox Serbs. Even if
the Government approached the Orthodox clergy, these
latter had only a very moderate control over their flock.
A Serb is always ready to subscribe towards the erection
of a new church, which he regards as most other nations
regard their flag; but when it is built he rarely enters
it. This being so, the Austro-Hungarian Government
tyrannized over the Serbs in Croatia by measures taken
against their schools, the Cyrillic alphabet and so forth.
It was natural that the suffering Serbs were apt to compare
these restrictions with those that were imposed
upon the Croats. However, among the <i>intelligentsia</i> an
effort&mdash;a fairly successful effort&mdash;was made to nullify
this dividing policy; the Serbo-Croat Coalition was
formed, one of the protagonists being Svetozar Pribi&#269;evi&#263;,
that very energetic Serb of Croatia, and in 1906 this party
obtained no less than sixty-eight seats, while the power
of the older Croat parties was correspondingly diminished
and Radi&#263; had his very small following in the Zagreb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Lantag. [Those who represented Croatia in the central
Parliament at Buda-Pest were chosen by the Ban, Khuen-Hed&eacute;rv&aacute;ry.
Those forty members had practically no
acquaintance with the Magyar language, so that some of
them drew their 8000 annual crowns and only went to
Pest if an important division was expected, others who
spent more time in the capital wasted their lives amid
surroundings just as riotous as and more expensive than
the Parliament, while only those did useful work who
managed to confer, behind the scenes, with the authorities.
To some extent this was done by Pribi&#269;evi&#263; and to a
greater extent by another Serb, Dr. Du&#353;an Popovi&#263;, who
surpassed him in capacity and geniality. It was he,
by the way, who demonstrated in the Buda-Pest Parliament
that if the average Croat deputy was ignorant of
the Magyar language, there was a greater ignorance of
Serbo-Croatian on the part of the Magyars. One day
when he had started on a speech in his native tongue he
was howled down after he had explained that he was
talking Serbian. He promised to continue in Croatian,
and did so without being interrupted.]</p>

<p>At Zagreb the fusion of the Croat and Serb <i>intelligentsia</i>
was still very incomplete at the outbreak of the
War&mdash;the Croat Star&#269;evist party and others going their
own way. During the War the Austro-Hungarian
Government ruled by means of the Coalition party; but
the latter had no choice, and throughout Croatia they
were never charged with infidelity to the Slav cause.
They did whatever their delicate situation permitted;
and in October 1918, when the Slavs of Croatia and
Slovenia threw off the yoke of centuries and joined with
the Serbs of Serbia and Montenegro, one hoped that the
simultaneous arrival in Belgrade of the Coalition and the
Star&#269;evist leaders heralded in Croatia a cessation of the
ancient hostility. Pribi&#269;evi&#263; became Minister of the
Interior in the new State, and very soon it was obvious
that he meant to govern in a centralizing fashion, despite
his earlier assurance that no such steps would be taken
without the sanction of the Constituent Assembly. No
doubt his motives were unimpeachable; he feared lest
the negative, anti-Serb mentality, which for so long had
flourished among the Croats, would not, except by drastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
methods, be removed. He was met with opposition.
Now you see, he cried, there are still in Croatia a number
of disloyal Slavs, great landowners, Catholic clergy and
others whom the Habsburgs used to favour. And he
continued, with hundreds of edicts, to try to weld the
State together. Consumed with patriotism, his great
black eyes on flame amid the pallor of his face&mdash;his luminous
and martyred face, to use the expression of his friends&mdash;he
never for a moment relaxed his efforts; if those who
opposed him were numerous it was all the more reason why
he must be resolute. The r&ocirc;le fitted him very well, for he is
the dourest politician in Yugoslavia&mdash;a perfectly honest, upright,
injudicious patriot. His Democratic party had now
taken the place of the Serbo-Croat Coalition and it saw the
other parties in Croatia gradually drifting back again from
it or rather from the dominating man; if his place had been
occupied by his afore-mentioned colleague, the burly and
beloved Du&#353;an Popovi&#263;, there would have been in Zagreb a
very much suaver atmosphere. But unfortunately Popovi&#263;
is a wealthy man, a highly successful lawyer who cares little
for the tumult of politics.... It was a thorny problem,
whether the State should be constituted on a federal
or a centralized basis.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The federation of the United
States depends on the centralization of political parties,
whereas in Yugoslavia the parties have only just begun
to combine. Feudalism in the German Empire rested on
the predominance of Prussia, a position which the Serbs
are, under present conditions, loth to occupy in Yugoslavia.
In Germany, moreover, many of the States used
to be independent, while in Yugoslavia this was only the
case with Serbia and Montenegro. Centralism would
tend to obliterate the tribal divisions, but on the other
hand it brings in its train bureaucracy, which is slow,
cumbrous and often corrupt; it demands unusually good
central institutions and first-rate communications, neither
of which are as yet in a satisfactory state. The constitution
has arrived at a compromise between the federal
and the centralized systems. A writer in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i> (November 1921) said that the division
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>of the whole of Yugoslavia into some twenty administrative
areas [he should have said thirty-three] to
replace the racial areas, was a very drastic proposal to
put forward; and he added that when the historic
provincial divisions of France were broken up into departments,
the nation had been prepared by nearly 200 years
of centralization under the monarchy. It is a flaw in his
argument to say that the previously existing areas were
racial, whereas populations of identical race were divided
from one another by the course of events. And in the
proposed obliteration of these divisions&mdash;to be effected
in a less arbitrary fashion than in France, where no account
was taken of the former provinces&mdash;it can scarcely be
maintained that, of itself, this part of the centralizing
programme in Yugoslavia is so very drastic.</p>

<p>Whatever one may think about the Balkan peoples
it is a fact that the essential Serb, the Serb from &#352;umadia,
is a pacific person, rather lazy perhaps, but certainly
more devoted to dancing than to battle. And some of
the wiser Serbs were dubious in 1919 and 1920 as to
whether the most sagacious methods were being employed
in Croatia. Radi&#263; was in prison, but they were told that
this impetuous demagogue was insisting on a republic,
and the Croat <i>intelligentsia</i> were far from happy. It is
true that in the elections of November 1920 the National
party, as the Star&#269;evists now called themselves, had no
great success; but the Radi&#263; party had more than half
the seats. Surely this had not been brought about
merely by the chief's imprisonment? There seemed to
be in that province some wider, some growing dissatisfaction.
And in the spring of 1921 most of the Catholic
Croats, those within and those without the Radi&#263; party,
were nourishing a score of grievances. No doubt a large
proportion of these were unavoidable (in view of the state
of Central Europe) or were rather trivial (the mayor of an
important town told me that he, who was under the
Minister of the Interior, had received an order from the
Belgrade Minister of War, with respect to the detention
of deserters&mdash;conditions, said he, were not so primitive in
the Austro-Hungarian monarchy) and sometimes the
grievances were against the Habsburgs (for not having
made them more fit to assume these new responsibilities),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and sometimes they were against the Serbs for being less
civilized&mdash;though they might be more moral&mdash;than
themselves, and sometimes the grievances were personal:
now and then after the Austrian collapse a Serbian
officer or his men, uncertain of the feelings of the population,
had acted with unwise, or rather with inexpedient,
vigour&mdash;instead of shooting those who in the general
anarchy were laying waste and plundering, they merely
flogged them, and this was for a long time remembered
against them, although the Croat <i>intelligentsia</i> who had
taken service in the police flogged in a far more wholesale
fashion. But down at the bottom of all the grievances
there is the fundamental fact that the Southern Slavs
yearn to be comrades, to shake off the differences which
in the course of ages have grown up between them.
These fraternal sentiments may be crudely expressed&mdash;it
has happened that a Slav from Bosnia (whose
ancestors adopted Islam some centuries ago) finds himself
in a Serbian village. He strikes up acquaintance with
some native. "What is your name?" asks the latter.
"Muhammed." The Serb has never heard of such a
name; he is puzzled. "Well, never mind," says he, and
takes his new friend back to dinner. They sit down to
the sucking pig. Muhammed refuses to partake of it, and
informs the Serb that Allah would be angry. "Don't be
afraid," says the Serb; "I'll tell him that it's my fault,"
and after a time he overcomes the Bosniak's scruples....
In more cultured circles the wonderful union of the
Southern Slavs is manifested after a different fashion, and
those neighbours who imagine that the afore-mentioned
grievances are going to dissolve the new State will one
day see how much they are mistaken. The Southern
Slavs intend to quarrel with each other, to quarrel like
brothers.</p>


<p class="section">THE SAD CASE OF PRIBI&#268;EVI&#262;</p>

<p>As between the Catholic and the Orthodox in Croatia
the sole uncertainty is whether this fusion will shortly
take place or after an interval. It is agreed by the most
malcontent schoolmasters that their pupils are growing
up to be excellent Yugoslavs who will have no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
fear of what they call "Serb hegemony" than have the
Scots of that of England. As for the present generation
of Croats and Serbs, if they were Occidentals they would
be old enough to laugh at each others' peculiarities and
each others' statesmen. But South-Eastern Europe is
still under the morning clouds, and they are inclined to
take seriously what we in the West make fun of. However,
there is one man whose presence in the Cabinet
the Croats cannot be expected to regard with good-humour
or with nonchalance. The reconciliation of
Croatia will be much more easily effected if Mr. Pribi&#269;evi&#263;
resigns. His merits as a demagogue and political writer
are undeniable. He would make an excellent Whip.
But he prefers to be a Minister, and most unfortunately
he is not a statesman. A zealous patriot, he is as yet
unable to conceive that the business of the State could
be more successfully managed without him. The sweets
of office appear, if anything, to have made him more
bitter; and even among the Serbs of the old kingdom
his withdrawal is considered advisable. A friend of his
has told me that in the middle of a laughing conversation
he threw out a hint of this, and like a cloud blown suddenly
across a summer sky, Pribi&#269;evi&#263;'s face grew black. Unhappily
he is not even Fortinbras and yet imagines he is
Hamlet. A good many people in Yugoslavia call him
<i>un homme fatal</i>, most of the others <i>l'homme fatal</i>. It is
said that in the Democratic party he is actively supported
by not more than ten deputies, but that the others, to
preserve the party, take no steps. He himself, however,
would probably have not the least hesitation in choosing
another party, if he could otherwise not stay in the
Cabinet; for his permanence in office is the one idea
that crushes every other from his mind. If he cannot
be Minister of the Interior&mdash;a post from which he has
been more than once, and happily for Yugoslavia, ejected&mdash;then
he insists on being Minister of Education. What
are his qualifications? Years ago he gave instruction
at a school for elementary teachers, and so faint a conception
has he of the educational needs of his country
that one day when a Professor of Belgrade University
asked him if no steps could be taken to diminish the
prohibitive cost of books, especially foreign books, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Minister simply stared at him as if he had been talking
Chinese. And yet in a recent book of national verses,
published by his brother Adam, we are told that:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-size: 90%"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At the table also sat the sage Pribi&#269;evi&#263;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can converse with Emperors...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are some who, curiously, have compared
Radi&#263;'s party with the Sinn Feiners; Radi&#263; may have
announced that he would approach the Serbs as the
representative of an independent country, but he never
proposed, even when his views were most extreme, to
realize them with physical force. At a great open-air
meeting of his adherents the speeches were so mild that
only twice did the Chief of Police, who was next to me,
raise a warning finger, and on each occasion to keep the
orator from very innocent digressions. Nevertheless,
there is no concealing the fact that even in these unsatisfactory
times&mdash;"It seems to me," said a philosophic
peasant recently at Valjevo, in the heart of Serbia, "it
seems to me that if we had a plebiscite then Valjevo
might not wish to remain with Serbia!"&mdash;even in a
world that is so awry the Croats are more reserved towards
the union than is good for the State. Perhaps they
would cherish fewer grievances if they had gained their
freedom with greater difficulty; and surely they need
have no more uneasiness than have the Scots that their
name and nationality will be swamped, for what the
Magyars were unable to do, that the Serbs do not wish
to do. There are among the Serbs a few extremists,
such as a pernicious editor or two, but their anti-Croat
tirades find extremely little favour anywhere. Last
autumn when the Prince-Regent (now King Alexander)
visited the Croat capital his reception was most enthusiastic.
"Let us keep him here!" cried the people, "and
let King Peter stay in Belgrade!" The Prince by his
tact brought the Croat out of his tent; he must not be
allowed to go back again&mdash;let the Southern Slavs observe
what each of their provinces can bring towards the
common good. The Croats acknowledge that the military
system of Serbia is more endurable&mdash;only one son is
taken out of each family&mdash;and that whereas in Slovenia
a lawsuit can be settled in fourteen days it has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
wont in Croatia to take as many years. Unfortunately
human nature, in Serbia, Croatia and everywhere else,
finds that the bad points of other people are more worthy
of comment than the good. When two brothers have
been brought up in very different circumstances there
will be so many points on which they differ; and when a
Serb taking part in a technical discussion of scientists
wishes to say that he differs from the previous speaker
he will commonly observe that that person has made a
fool of himself. When an editor alludes to a political
opponent he may call him an assassin and be much
astonished if this is resented. "Je suis un ours," said
a Serbian savant of European repute; occasionally he
behaves like one and is rather proud of it. The Serbs
of Croatia have been imitating, nay exaggerating, the
emphatic manners of their countrymen in the old kingdom.
And Pribi&#269;evi&#263;, as Minister of Education, has not attempted
to give the Croats a tactful course in courage,
patriotism and morality, where they have much to learn
from the less civilized Serbs, but scowling at them he
has made up his mind that, in and out of school, they
must straightway be the closest of companions.</p>

<p>However, the Serbs and Croats have a man whose
counsel is more worthy of attention. Dr. Trumbi&#263;,
formerly the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had been elected
at the head of four different lists in his native Dalmatia
but had entered the Constituent Assembly without giving
his allegiance to any party. And in April 1921 he made
a speech as memorable as it was long, for it occupied
the whole of one sitting and was continued the next day.
Careless of the applause and the antagonism which he
excited, the serene orator pointed out that the conflict
between Serbs and Croats was based on their different
psychology. Croatia had had her independent life and
must be considered as a factor in Yugoslavia; but having
come in, like Montenegro, of her own accord, she had not
wished to be a separate factor. Traditions should not
be so lightly set aside; and while there was perhaps no
people more homogeneous than the Yugoslavs it should
be remembered that none was more ready to resist the
application of force.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">LESSONS OF THE MONTENEGRIN ELECTIONS</p>

<p>Except at Kola&#353;in, where a few friends of Nikita
tried their brigand tactics, there was perfect calm in
Montenegro during the elections. As elsewhere in Yugoslavia,
there was a general amnesty and a prohibition,
for the three preceding days, to sell wine or rakia. The
ten elected candidates, all of them for the Yugoslav
union and against Nikita, were equally divided between
Radicals and Democrats on the one hand and Communists
and Republicans on the other. The authorities took
not the slightest step to favour any candidate; various
prominent deputies, such as Dr. Yoyi&#263;, the Minister of
Food Supply, were beaten. And in a letter to the Press
we were told by Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P., that these
elections were certainly both "farcical and fraudulent."
He is contradicted by Mr. Roland Bryce, who, after his
excellent work on the Allied Plebiscite Commission in
Carinthia, was sent by the Foreign Office with Major
L.&nbsp;E. Ottley to report on the Montenegrin elections.
He says (in Command Paper I., 124) that "in actual
practice the method of voting prescribed by the electoral
law was found to ensure absolute secrecy (the system
adopted being the only feasible one in a country where
the proportion of illiterates is great), and the manner
in which the ballot was supervised and carried out was
unimpeachable and proof against the most exacting
criticism." Mr. M'Neill is also contradicted by the
Republican candidate, M. Gjonovi&#263;, who in a manifesto
drawn up after the election declares that "none can say
that the elections were not free, or that anyone who
wished could not make up a list. At the elections only
the lists and boxes of the Republicans, Democrats, Independents,
Radicals and Communists were represented.
All of these parties had in their programmes the motto
'The people and State union,' with, of course, different
points of view and different opinions as to the organization
of our national and State forces, except the Communists,
who go further and desire the union of all
peoples."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">WHICH ONE GENTLEMAN REFUSES TO TAKE</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the friends of Nikita were
altogether wrong in suggesting that those who voted
for the Republicans or Communists were opposed to the
union with Serbia in Yugoslavia. Both Republicans
and (paradoxical though it sounds) the Communists
resented this insinuation very bitterly; and considering
that the leaders of both parties are pronounced antagonists
of the old r&eacute;gime, and were indeed severally condemned to
death by Nikita, it would have been strange if they now
supported him. Thus every single programme put forward
by the different parties included, in some form or other,
union with Serbia. The candidates themselves explicitly
said so; but Mr. M'Neill knows better, and informs
us how very hostile to the Serbs they really were. He
is a wonderful man, Mr. M'Neill. Standing up in the
House of Commons he directs his penetrating gaze upon
the Black Mountain, and with such effect that he can see
in the minds of Montenegrin politicians what they themselves
had never dreamed of. Since we have such a
man as Mr. M'Neill in the country, one would think that
the Foreign Office might have saved itself the expense
of sending out Mr. Bryce and Major Ottley.</p>

<p>But since we have it, let us look at Mr. Bryce's very
interesting and detailed report. After explaining that
both Republicans and Communists were in favour of
union with Serbia, he tells us how it happened that so
many people voted for these two lists instead of for the
orthodox Radical and Democratic parties. The Communists,
according to Mr. Bryce, were benefited by a
party organization, a vigorous canvass and a better
discipline than that of any of their opponents. Their
policy won the support of many ardent and very patriotic
Nationalists, who voted in many cases for Communism
on the ground that it was the Russian policy&mdash;out of
gratitude for what the Tzars had done for Montenegro
in the past! Major Temperley, assistant military attach&eacute;,
in another report (Command Paper I., 123) observes that
some local discontent had arisen in Montenegro because
the native does not understand, and has never experienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
before, a really efficient system of government, and
because the introduction of conscription was not well
adapted to the national tradition of lawless and untrained
vigour. Major Temperley testifies that the Republican
party gained the suffrages of numerous returned emigrants
who admired the state of things in America. He shares
Mr. Bryce's opinion as to the insignificance of the pro-Nikita
party. "Even making large allowances," says
he, "there seemed to me to be no doubt that the pro-Nicholas
party were the weakest in Montenegro." Certain
of his devotees were simply brigands who, like the
Neapolitan miscreants after 1860, sought to cast a glamour
over their depredations by affecting to be in arms on
behalf of their former King. This personage himself
was so well aware of his unpopularity that he was prudent
enough to tell his supporters to abstain from voting.
Those who did abstain were altogether only 32&middot;69 per cent.
of the electors, though one would have been justified
in expecting a much higher proportion, since the people
have not yet fully grasped their rights and duties with
respect to the franchise; the distances to the booths were
often very great, and the peasants were often indifferent
as to whether one candidate or another with a very
similar programme should be elected. The tribal or
family system is still so prevalent in the villages that one
member of a family would be sent to express the considered
views of his fellows. The effect of the elections
being held on a Sunday was to increase rather than
diminish the number of abstainers, for although Sunday
is a public holiday the Christian Montenegrin is under no
obligation to hear Mass and for that reason travel to the
village. The churches are practically deserted, for he
is accustomed on that day to remain at home; while
the Moslem voters largely declined to vote because there
were no Moslem candidates. That is why it would appear
that those of the 32&middot;69 per cent. who abstained because
they were in favour of Nikita were extremely few. Their
simple-mindedness has its limits, while that of good
Mr. M'Neill believes that because France, Great Britain
and America undertook to restore Montenegrin independence,
they were still obliged to do so after they perceived
at the conclusion of the War that an overwhelming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
majority of Montenegrins did not desire it. This majority
dethroned its traitor-king; but Mr. M'Neill maintains
that France and England have dethroned "a monarch
who was a friend and an ally."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Because M. Poincar&eacute;,
in the days before the Montenegrins had rejected Nikita,
addressed him as "Very Dear and Great Friend"&mdash;the
ordinary form of words for a reigning monarch&mdash;Mr.
M'Neill actually seems to think that France was for
evermore compelled to clasp Nikita to her bosom. He
clearly admires those who, since the end of the War,
have risen in the cause of their old King; and I suppose
that in consequence he disapproves of the Omladina,
the voluntary association of men who banded themselves
together to resist the terrorism of the pro-King komitadjis.
If he had been in Montenegro during the years after the
War he would possibly agree that komitadji is the proper
name for the many lawless elements who have found
the traditional fighting life more congenial than the
thankless task of tilling their very barren land. The
moral effect of opposing to these the Montenegrin Omladina
instead of Serbian troops was to destroy all pretence of
the movement being a national Montenegrin insurrection
against the union, and the cessation of assistance from
Italy resulted in the complete suppression of the movement.
The few outlaws who still remain at large, said
Mr. Bryce in December 1920, are in no sense political,
but are merely bandits. And as the Omladina has now
no <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> they have disbanded themselves. Much
now depends on the Constitution. If it gives them equal
rights&mdash;and naturally it will&mdash;with the other inhabitants
of Yugoslavia the Montenegrins will be content.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">In August 1921 the <i>Secolo</i> of Milan sent a famous
correspondent to Montenegro. He came to much the
same conclusions as Messrs. Bryce and Temperley. Not
a single political prisoner was to be found, and not one
of the ex-soldiers who returned from Gaeta had been
molested. The correspondent thought that the Serbs
had been ill-advised at the beginning to employ forcible
methods against the pro-Nikita partisans who were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>opposed to Yugoslavia; they should, said he, have let
the pear ripen spontaneously and fall into their lap.
But now their policy had become one of conciliation:
during the last two and a half years Montenegro had
received from Belgrade for public works, pensions and
subsidies, 93 million dinars, and had paid in taxes only 5
millions. Secondary education had been increased, and
700 Montenegrin students (of whom 500 are allotted
a monthly grant) frequent Yugoslav universities. The
fertile lands of Yugoslavia were open to Montenegrin
emigration. In fact an isolated, independent Montenegro
was no longer needed. With the disappearance of the
Turk from all Serbian territory in 1913 a return to the
union of the Serbs, as in the days of Stephen Du&#353;an,
was only hindered by historical, sentimental and, above
all, by dynastic reasons. It was sad, quoth the correspondent,
that the glorious history of Montenegro should
have come to such a tame end, but her historic mission
was closed in 1913, even as that of Scotland in 1707,
to the benefit of both parties. Now the Serbs were
leaving them to manage their own affairs; many ex-Nikita
officials had been confirmed in their posts, while
officers were given their old rank in the Yugoslav army.
It is unfortunate for itself that the "Near East" (of
London) does not employ so discerning a correspondent.
We should then hear no more of such folly as that which&mdash;to
select one occasion out of many&mdash;caused it in November
1921 to speak about "the forcible absorption of Montenegro."
And the world may be pardoned if it is more
ready to accept the observations made on the spot by
an expert Italian correspondent rather than the futile
remarks sent by the Hon. Aubrey Herbert from the
House of Commons, also in November 1921, to the
<i>Morning Post</i>. This gentleman informs us that "it was
probably because the Yugoslav Government was allowed
to annex the ancient principality of Montenegro, exile
its King, and subjugate its people, without any interference
from the Great Powers, that M. Pasitch thought
that he could do as he liked in Albania." That is the
sort of statement which one may treat with Matthew
Arnold's "patient, deep disdain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">MEDI&AElig;VAL DOINGS AT RIEKA</p>

<p>On July 14, 1920, a letter marked "urgent" (No.
2047) was written by Colonel Sani, the Chief of
d'Annunzio's Cabinet, in which he confirmed the orders
which he had already given verbally, to the effect that
all the foreign elements, especially the Serbs and Croats,
who "exercise an obnoxious political influence," should
be expelled from Rieka at the earliest possible date; he
mentions that this is the command of d'Annunzio, who
is in full accord with the President of the Consiglio
Nazionale. This was the continuation of a practice which
the Italian authorities had carried on in a wholesale
manner. Father J.&nbsp;N. Macdonald, in his unimpeachable
little book, <i>A Political Escapade</i> (London, 1921), gives us
numerous examples of persons who in the most wanton
fashion were expelled from the town. Thus a merchant
called Pliskovac was arrested by the carabinieri, while
talking to some English soldiers. After three days, spent
under arrest, he was told that he would have to depart
"from Italy" (<i>sic</i>). He was given a <i>faglio di via obligatorio</i>
by the carabinieri, according to which he was
banished on the ground of being "unemployed." Yet
this man had had a fixed residence in Rieka for thirty-six
years, was employed as a merchant, and furnished with a
regular industrial certificate.... His name had been
found on one of the lists in favour of annexation to
Yugoslavia. When the world in general turned its
attention away from Rieka, very much relieved to think
that there would be an end to all the turmoil now that
an agreement had at last been reached and the poor
harassed place was to be neutral, it presumed that those
among her citizens who had been openly in arms against
the other party would as soon as possible resign. They
would have been astonished to be told that the notorious
self-elected Consiglio Nazionale Italiano, under the selfsame
President, Mr. Grossich, cheerfully remained in
office. It is true that they now called themselves the
"Provisional Government"; in Paris and London this
change of title made a good deal more impression than
upon the local Yugoslavs, whose treatment did not vary.
A decree was printed on January 21, 1921, in the <i>Vedetta</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
which laid it down that the expulsions ordered by the
previous Government retained their force, but that
appeals might be addressed to the Rector of the Interior.
A deputation was received by this gentleman, and was told
that the procedure would be so complicated and so
lengthy that it would not permit any one to return until
after the elections. These elections had been fixed for
the end of April, and it seemed as if France and England
were so blinded by the blessed words "Provisional
Government" that they could see nothing else. That
over 2000 arditi, clothed in mufti, had either stayed from
the d'Annunzian era or been since introduced was surely
gossip, and how could anyone believe that those men had
been granted citizenship on the simple declaration of a
Rieka shopkeeper, or some such person, that the applicant
worked under him? These declarations, by the way,
must have refrained from going into details, for there
was an almost total lack of work&mdash;except in the political
department of the police. Rieka was to all intents in
the possession of Italy, and she was learning what that
meant. The town was like a dead place, shops were only
open in the morning, and if the shopkeepers had not been
compelled by the authorities to remove their shutters
they would have strolled down to the quays where the
grass was growing&mdash;"but, thank Heaven," cried Grossich,
"thank Heaven, it is Italian grass!" (If he ever recalls
that long-distant day, when, as a student, he fought for
his fellow-Croats, and when, as a young doctor, he was
an enthusiastic official of the Croat Club at Castua near
Rieka, perhaps this gentleman thanks his God for having
led him to Rieka and turned him into an Italian.) Cut
off from its Yugoslav hinterland the population of Rieka,
which consisted more and more of arditi and fascisti, less
and less of Yugoslavs, the population had nothing to
do save to speculate in the rate of exchange (but not in
the local notes which no one wanted) and to prepare for
the elections. Thus, with time very heavy on their hands,
there was a great deal of corruption; cocaine could be
obtained at nearly all the caf&eacute;s. The elections drew
nearer, and one wondered whether the Entente was going
to look at the lists of voters and to inquire how it came
that many natives of the town were not inscribed. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was likely to happen if the place was delivered altogether
to the C.N.I. could be seen when the harbour of
Baro&#353;, given by the Rapallo Treaty to Yugoslavia, was
demanded, simply demanded, by the Italian Nationalists;
those ultra-patriots the fascisti, in Italy and in Rieka,
when they saw that in the "holocaust city" everything
was going just as well for them as in the brave days of
d'Annunzio, persisted loudly in claiming Baro&#353; as an integral
part of Rieka. The Yugoslavs must be prevented,
wherever possible, from approaching the Adriatic&mdash;this
being the furious policy of the Italian capitalists who had
succeeded in sweeping most of the Italian people off their
feet. With Baro&#353;, a port of limited possibilities, in the
hands of the Yugoslavs, it would mean that the adjacent
Rieka through its Yugoslav commerce would prosper;
but anything that savoured of a Yugoslav Rieka was
obnoxious to the capitalists and their wild followers,
since they feared that in the first place it would raise a
grievous obstacle to their penetration of the Balkans, and
secondly it would involve the ruin of Triest, where German
capital still plays a predominant part. So in their folly
they strenuously fought for the Germans, spurred on by
the terrible thought that Rieka might become predominantly
Yugoslav. They refused to listen to their
wiser men, who pointed out that the possession of an odd
town or island was to Italy of not so much importance as
friendship with their Slav neighbours. When, at the
beginning of April 1921 a large sailing boat, the <i>Rad</i>
(Captain Vlaho Grubi&#353;i&#263;) came into Baro&#353;, the first ship
to bring the Yugoslav flag to that port, there was intense
commotion among the fascisti. Forty of them with
weapons ran down to the harbour, but Grubi&#353;i&#263; told them
that he saw no reason why he should not fly the flag of
his State. A number of workmen, Italians and Yugoslavs,
then appeared and made common cause against the
fascisti, so that the latter withdrew. And the captain
of the Italian warship <i>Carlo Mirabello</i> sent to ask Grubi&#353;i&#263;
if he had removed the flag. On hearing that he had not
done so the captain said that he had acted perfectly
correctly. It seems to be too much to hope that such
honourable Italians as this captain and these workmen
will be able, without certain measures on the part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
France and England, to prevail over those elements
who have dragged Rieka down to death and to dishonour.</p>

<p>At last, on April 25, the elections were held. There
were two parties, that of the C.N.I., swollen with arditi
and fascisti, who would have nothing to do with the
Treaty of Rapallo&mdash;their programme consisted in annexation
to Italy&mdash;and the other party, whose object was to
carry out the provisions of the Treaty. Professor Zanella
was its chief. There did not seem to be much hope that
it would be successful, although it contained what was
left of the Autonomists, who in 1919 were the largest
party&mdash;desiring that the town should be neither Yugoslav
nor Italian&mdash;and these Autonomists were now reinforced
by the Yugoslavs. But so numerous had been the
expulsions that many of the survivors feared that it
would be futile to vote, and on the other hand the Annexionist
party was quite confident that it would win.
During the afternoon of the election day, however, they
perceived that the impossible was happening, and that
Zanella was marching to victory. Thereupon the enraged
fascisti had recourse to violence. "Zanella's victory was
intolerable to these patriots," said <i>La Nazione</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> "because
they remembered the two years of tenacity and of splendid
Italian spirit and of suffering which the town had lived
through." Most of the electors remembered the suffering.
The fascisti seized a number of urns and made a bonfire
of them; there was presented the spectacle of Signor
Gigante, d'Annunzio's obedient mayor, bursting with
armed companions into that room of the Palace of Justice
where the votes were being scrutinized. "I yield to
violence," said the presiding official; and twenty minutes
afterwards the contents of the urns were burning merrily.
But these measures did not help the cause of the fascisti,
no more than did their screams that they had been
betrayed. And if Zanella had to fly from Rieka because,
as the Nationalist paper put it, he could not stand up
against the vehement indignation of so many of the
citizens, yet he and his party have triumphed. "Fiume
or Death," used to be the device dear to d'Annunzio.
He placarded the long-suffering walls with it, and it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>on the lapels of the coats of his adherents. "Fiume must
belong to Italy or be blown up," cried the poet. But,
strange to say, a majority of the inhabitants prefer that
their town should continue to exist, and this it can only
do if, in accordance with the Treaty of Rapallo, it becomes
a neutral State on friendly terms with both its neighbours,
Italy and Yugoslavia. The Italian Government desires,
of course, to execute its Treaty obligations,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and if it finds
too painful the task of moderating the ardours of its own
super-patriots, it will no doubt be glad to have this done by
an International force. That method, which was only
prevented by d'Annunzio's arrival in 1919, offers the
speediest and most efficacious solution of Rieka's troubles.</p>


<p class="section">THE STRICKEN TOWN</p>

<p>If anyone imagined that they would be ended with
the installation of Zanella he was wrong. At the municipal
elections 90 per cent. voted for the Autonomist
party, the Yugoslavs having had the good sense to join
them. But the Italian Nationalists were not going to
yield to moderation, and immediately after the elections
Zanella was obliged to flee for his life, so that he was
not installed in office until October 5. He struggled
manfully to clear away the chaos and to make such
economic arrangements as would eventually convert
Rieka into a prosperous port. This the fascisti of Triest
and Venice could by no means tolerate, and on January 31
an unsuccessful attempt was made by them on his life
as he was leaving the Constituent Assembly. On February
16 the Anai (Assoziazione Nazionale fra gli Arditi
d'Italia) sent out a very urgent message from their headquarters
in the Via Macchiavelli in Triest. They informed
the subsections that not only was Zanella preparing
to deliver Rieka to the Croats, but that the army of
the "globe-trotter" Wrangel was waiting in Su&#353;ak to
seize the wretched town. Therefore Gabriele d'Annunzio
had commanded that every loyal servant of the cause
was to be mobilized. And after a few rhetorical sentences
it continued, "I will give the marching orders by telegram
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>as follows: 'Send the documents. Farina.' If only
a small number of people are needed I will telegraph,
'Send ... Quintal. Farina.'" The men were to
assemble at the Italian Labour Bureau, 9 Via Pozza
Bianca in Triest. They were to be clad in mufti, to be
armed so far as it was possible and to have with them
three days' provender.... The subsections are asked
to telegraph the approximate number of those on whom
they can rely. And this memorandum should be acknowledged.
It is signed, "With brotherly greetings. Farina
Salvatore." About ten days later&mdash;between February 26
and 28&mdash;there was a meeting at the Hotel Imperial in
Vienna, under the presidency of Vilim Stipeti&#263;, formerly
a major of the Austrian General Staff. Some dissident
Croats&mdash;among them Dr. Emanuel Gagliardi, Captains
Cankl and Petri&#269;evi&#263;, Gjuro Kli&#353;uri&#263;, Josip Boldin and
Major-General I&#353;tvanovi&#263;&mdash;two dissident Montenegrins,
Jovo Plamenac and Marko Petrovi&#263;, together with two
Italian officers, adherents of d'Annunzio, Colonel Finzi
of Triest and Major Ventura of Rome, ... assembled
for the purpose of stirring up trouble for the Yugoslavs
in the spring. They referred with pleasure to the presence
of sundry Bulgarian komitadjis in Albania, Finzi declared
that the Italian Government would satisfy the Croats
and give them Rieka as soon as Croatia had achieved
her independence and a less visionary promise was made
of disturbances in Rieka. On March 1 the two Italian
officers left for Triest and on March 3 Rieka was confronted
with another <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. The fascisti of Triest
and of Gulia Venetia descended on the town in two
special trains of the Italian State Railway. They had
not the slightest confidence in Zanella, who was an honest
man, working on the basis of the Treaty of Rapallo,
whereby Italy and Yugoslavia recognized the Free State
of Rieka. In their eyes it was a monstrous thing that
Italy should be expected to observe this instrument.
So let the town be freed, let Zanella be expelled. And
as he only had at his disposal a force of about three
hundred local gendarmes, with rifles but without munition,
it was not particularly difficult for the fascisti heroes to
accomplish their task. Zanella had to fly once more.</p>

<p>"If Italy were to offend against the freedom and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
independence of the State of Rieka she would deprive
herself," said Signor Schanzer, the Italian Foreign Secretary
"she would deprive herself of the name of a Great
Power and in the Society of Nations she would retain
no authority." Thus did the successor of the relentless
but unavailing della Torretta try, with eloquent and
noble words, to wipe the blot from Italy's scutcheon.
She could scarcely have the nations coming to the Congress
of Genoa, there to debate with regard to the economic
re-establishment of Europe, while her own conduct was
so very much under suspicion. It would have been
rather curious, so the <i>Zagreber Tagblatt</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> pointed out,
for a robber to invite you to his house with a view to
taking steps against robbery. Something drastic had
to be done, so that Europe would not look askance at
the Italian Government. Zanella, it was true, had been
thrown out&mdash;but why should not the world be told that
this had been effected by the people of the town? A
very excellent idea! And so a certain Lieut. Cabruna
of the <i>gendarmerie</i> made a plan to get together the
Constituent Assembly and then&mdash;well, there are always
methods by which resolutions can be passed. Perhaps
it would not even be necessary for a single rifle to be
fired at the deputies from the Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery. But most of the deputies succeeded in escaping
from the town, although frantic efforts were made to
prevent them. Out of the threescore only thirteen poor
devils were held fast and came to the futile meeting.
The others, with Zanella, assembled on Yugoslav territory
at a place called Saint Anna.</p>

<p>And Signor Schanzer went on talking. Officers and
men of the Italian army and navy, said he, had shown
perfect discipline. Signor Schanzer may not be an
expert on discipline, but as a humorist he wins applause.
One's ordinary notions of discipline do not include the
seizure of a warship by a handful of bandits, the cannons
of the vessel being afterwards directed against the Government
palace of a neutral State. The fascisti, with the
help of Italian troops and accompanied by several
Italian deputies, eject the legal Government of Rieka.
One of these deputies, Giuratti, is chosen by his friends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>to be President of the Free State&mdash;Giuratti of the fascisti,
Giuratti who most barbarically had ill-treated the Istrian
Slavs, but&mdash;for we will be just&mdash;this was when he believed
they were barbarians, savages, quite common, brutal
men; well, he had learned, he wrote,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that this was not
the case, they had adopted Western culture, they had
raised the revolutionary flag against the dynasty of
Karageorgevi&#263; and if Yugoslavia's dismemberment
should ever come to pass, "then, as I confidently hope,"
said he, "the Croats with their righteous national aspirations
will unite with their great neighbour Italy. We
salute the Croat Revolution with sincerest sympathy..."
and so on and so on. That was the kind of calm, impartial
personage to have as Governor of the distracted Free
State, where in one point anyhow most of the population
think the same, and that is that their union with Italy
would be an absolute disaster. Behold this Giuratti
posing his candidature, Giuratti whose patriotism and
idealism are, says the Italian Government, fully appreciated
by them; nevertheless it has advised him to
refuse the suggested honour. That he should be punished
did not occur to them; but what would they have said
if a Yugoslav&mdash;surely with more right than an Italian
and certainly with a larger following of townsfolk&mdash;had
been selected as President? "The proceedings of the
Italian Government," said Schanzer, "are clear, speedy
and determined." But did anything unpleasant happen
to Commandant Castelli, an officer sent to make order,
when he quite openly placed himself on the side of the
fascisti? Would degradation be the lot of any officer
or soldier who "mutinied" and joined the fascisti?...
Apparently it was due to the unhappy political condition
of Europe that the whole civilized world did not launch
an indignant protest against the baseness and cynicism
of the Italians. But how utterly they failed to persuade
others that the wishes of Rieka were as they represented
them! Rieka desires to remain independent and this
desire the Italians will have to respect. And the later
they make up their mind to keep their promises, so much
the worse for them. The Yugoslavs can wait, for theirs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>is the future. A cartoonist in the Belgrade <i>Vreme</i> depicted
a rough old Serbian warrior holding on his open hand a
very neat little Italian soldier. "Now listen to me,"
he was saying, "and I will tell you a story. Once upon
a time there was a country called Austria...."</p>

<p>There was a characteristic little affair at Saint Anna
on March 23. A few minutes after Zanella had left the
Lubi&#263; Inn a suspicious-looking person appeared. He
began observing the customers and their surroundings,
when the Police-Commissary Per&#353;i&#263; came up to him and
asked for his passport. "Take yourself off!" shouted
the intruder, as he pulled a bomb out of his trouser
pocket. Per&#353;i&#263; grappled with him and soon overpowered
him. And outside the house four other fascisti, Armano
Viola, Carpinelli, Bellia and Murolo, were captured.
They claimed to be journalists, and it is quite true that
Viola is on the staff of the notorious <i>Vedetta Italiana</i>;
but when he comes into a foreign country as a special
correspondent and is teaching others how to go about
that business&mdash;for until then they had been otherwise
engaged, Murolo being charged with numerous thefts
and attempted murders, while Bellia and Carpinelli
were accused of breaking into the Abbazia Casino&mdash;if
Viola was teaching them how to be journalists he would
on this occasion have been better advised if he had restricted
them to the conventional tools of the profession
instead of bombs, revolvers and daggers. Little use
did they get out of them, for a trio of these armed individuals
were seized and disarmed by one Yugoslav
gendarme, who was himself very meagrely equipped.
With tears in their eyes they begged for mercy. "Piet&agrave;,
Piet&agrave;!" they exclaimed. So long as their own lives
were spared they were very willing to forgo the 60,000
lire which had been put on Zanella's head.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it seems obvious that this exploit, if
not ordered by the Italian Government was, at any rate,
permitted by them. How otherwise could the automobile
containing these men have got past the sentries
at the Su&#353;ak bridge and two other Italian sentry posts?
Moreover, these men were in possession of documents
which proved that official Italian circles at Rieka were
privy to their undertaking, and that they proposed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
investigate the Yugoslav military positions on the frontier....
These five fascisti brigands&mdash;who were also
lieutenants of the Italian army&mdash;would therefore have
to be tried not only for attempted murder but for
attempted espionage. They were put into a train and
transported to the prison at Zagreb. "If once we begin
to march," so the Italian soldiers at Rieka had over
and over again been telling the Croats, "then we shall
not halt before we come to Zagreb, your capital." Those
five will perhaps some day explain to their comrades how
quickly Zagreb can be reached.... As yet those whom
they left behind them had not lost their bombast: a
manifesto was issued by them which declared that five
true patriots had sallied forth to Saint Anna, for the
purpose of parleying with the Constituent Assembly,
and that in a barbarous fashion they had been arrested,
maltreated and possibly killed. Let the people avenge
the shedding of such noble blood. Everything, everything
must be done in order to liberate the captured
brethren. And so, towards eleven at night, about sixty
fascisti and legionaries came together. Armed to the
teeth, they designed to cross over into Yugoslav territory,
but when they noticed that the sentry posts had been
strengthened they went home to bed.</p>

<p>A number of American and European journalists
rushed out to Belgrade, under the impression that the
Yugoslav-Italian War could now no longer be avoided.
But they did not realize how great a self-control the
Yugoslavs possess. It may be, as a commentator put
it in the <i>Nation</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> that Italy "is practically at war with
Yugoslavia," for she is obsessed by the "Pan-Slav
menace"; but if they insist on the arbitrament of arms
they will have to wait until the Yugoslavs have time to
deal with them.... The Free State of Rieka owes its
existence to a Treaty between Italy and Yugoslavia;
both of them should therefore guarantee its freedom.
Italian and Yugoslav <i>gendarmerie</i> and troops should
resist together the incursions of fascisti; and if the two
races cannot work in harmony, then let the administration
of the town be entrusted to neutral troops; and as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>High Commissioner one would suggest Mr. Blakeney,
the British Consul at Belgrade. If this imperturbable
and most kindly man were to fail in the attempt at
repeating in Rieka what has been accomplished in Danzig,
then, indeed, one might despair; but he would brilliantly
and placidly succeed. All the other qualifications are
his; an intimate knowledge of every Near Eastern
language&mdash;and, of course, Italian; a perfect acquaintance
with the mentality of all those peoples; common sense
of an uncommon order, and the whole-hearted confidence
of those with whom he comes into contact. Great
Britain and France compelled the Yugoslavs, at enormous
sacrifices, to sign the Treaty of Rapallo; they are, therefore,
morally obliged to see that it is executed. For too
many months the Italians were saying that they would
carry out their part of it and leave the third zone in
Dalmatia if the Yugoslavs would agree to a few more
concessions, commercial and territorial, that were not
in the Treaty. During the Genoa Conference in the spring
of 1922 the Italian authorities confessed to the Yugoslav
delegates that their hands were bound by the fascisti.
These elements would certainly object to the execution
of that part of the Treaty of Rapallo which refers to the
port of Baro&#353;. Accurately speaking, the arrangements
with regard to Baro&#353; are embodied in a letter from Count
Sforza, the then Foreign Secretary, and are added to the
Treaty as an appendix. Both were signed on the same
day, and apparently this plan of an appendix was adopted
on account of the fascisti. Yet if Count Sforza had not
signed that letter it is safe to say that the Yugoslavs
would not have signed the main body of a Treaty which
to them was the reverse of favourable. And at Genoa
the Italians started haggling about a strip of land near
Baro&#353;, in the hope that some success would stay the zeal
of the fascisti. Furthermore they pleaded that Zadar
could not live if Yugoslavia did not, in addition to supplying
it with water, give it railway communication with
the interior. The Yugoslavs were thus invited to construct
at great expense a railway to a foreign town which
their own &#352;ibenik and other Adriatic towns did not
possess. This, naturally, they refused to undertake,
as also to agree to the Italian suggestion that a free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
zone of some twenty kilometres should be instituted at
the back of Zadar. One might safely say that the Italian
agents in this region would not have confined themselves
to salutary measures for the welfare of the town. It is
stated in the Treaty of Rapallo that in case of disagreement
either party could invoke an arbitrator, and the
Yugoslavs, who happen now to be the weaker party,
have been contemplating application to the League of
Nations. Well, in Genoa it was proposed by Italy that
Yugoslavia should renounce the clause which deals with
an eventual arbitration. If you make a large number of
demands&mdash;never mind that they should be in opposition
to a Treaty you have signed&mdash;then you may gain a few
of them&mdash;and Italy was hoping that the Free State
would repay the costs which she incurred there on account
of her unruly son d'Annunzio, and, likewise, that the good
Italianists who at the end of the Great War committed
wholesale thefts from the State warehouses should not
be made to pay for it. With all their guile and strength
the Italians were endeavouring to avoid the execution
of her Treaty of Rapallo. "Italy is the one Power in
Europe," says Mr. Harold Goad<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> who thrusts himself
upon our notice, "Italy is the one Power in Europe
that is most obviously and most consistently working
for peace and conciliation in every field."</p>


<p class="section">HOPES IN THE LITTLE ENTENTE</p>

<p>The complicated troubles, avoidable and unavoidable,
that have been raging in Central Europe after the War are
being met to some extent by the Little Entente, an
association in the first place between Yugoslavia and the
kindred Czecho-Slovakia, and afterwards between them
and Roumania. The world was assured that this union
had for its object the establishment of peace, security
and normal economic activities in Central and Eastern
Europe; no acquisitive purposes were in the background,
and since these three States now recognized that if
they try to swallow more of the late Austro-Hungarian
monarchy they will suffer from chronic indigestion, we
need not be suspicious of their altruism. It is perfectly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>true that the first impulse which moved the creators of
the Little Entente was not constructive but defensive;
their great Allies did not appear, in the opinion of the
three Succession States, to be taking the necessary precautions
against the elements of reaction. Otherwise
they, especially France (which was naturally more determined
that Austria should not join herself to Germany),
would not have favoured the idea of a Danubian Federation,
in which Austria and Hungary would play leading
parts. The Great Powers would also, if they had been
less exclusively concerned with their own interests, have
handled with more resolution the attempts of Charles of
Habsburg to place himself at the head of the present
reactionary r&eacute;gime at Buda-Pest; and if it had not
been for certain energetic measures taken by the members
of the Little Entente it may well be doubted whether
the Government of Admiral Horthy, which does not
conceal the fact that it is royalist&mdash;the king being temporarily
absent&mdash;would have required Charles to leave
the country. The Little Entente pointed out to their
great Allies what these had apparently overlooked,
namely, that the return of the Habsburgs was not opposed
by the Succession States out of pure malice but for the
reason that it would inevitably strengthen the magnates
and the high ecclesiastics in their desire to bring about the
restoration of Hungary's old frontiers. As the frontiers
are now drawn there dwell&mdash;and this could not be prevented&mdash;a
number of Magyars in each of the three neighbouring
States (the fewest being in Yugoslavia), just as
the present Hungary includes a Czech-Slovak, Roumanian
and Yugoslav population.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> But the Great Powers agree
that if this frontier is to be changed at all, every precaution
should be taken against having it changed by
force. It is no exaggeration to say that there can be no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>real peace in Central Europe until normal intercourse
with Russia is re-established, but let it in the meantime
be the task of the Little Entente to guard the temporary
peace from being shattered.</p>

<p>Apart from this defensive object the countries of the
Little Entente have the positive aim of a resumption of
normal economic conditions and the institution of a new
order of things in accordance with the new political
construction of Central and Eastern Europe. It is obvious
that these three States have numerous interests in common
which make their co-operation very natural, if not indeed
indispensable.</p>

with his precise requirements sailed over from Italy and said they had
been captured by d'Annunzio's arditi. General Badoglio, in command of
the royal troops outside the town, ascertained in November 1919 that
Rieka's coal-supply was nearly exhausted and 7000 tons per month were
required for the public services alone. He accordingly informed a
syndicate of coal merchants in Triest that he would be personally responsible
for the first consignment of coal to d'Annunzio. A month earlier,
when the town was supposed to be blockaded, it was announced that a
limited supply of food-stuffs would, nevertheless, be introduced, through
the Red Cross, for very young children. This amounted, as a matter of
fact, to 21 truckloads a week. It is significant that there was no rise
in the prices charged in the public restaurants of Rieka, and that persons
living outside the line of Armistice found it cheaper to do their shopping
in the besieged city.</p></div>

He remarked that one could not expect this Minister to be sober at four

<i>Saturday Review</i> (which arose from an unsigned and, I hoped, rather
reasonable article of mine on the Adriatic Settlement) I quoted from
memory this passage of Mrs. Re-Bartlett's and said that the Italian
captain was giving chocolates to the children at Kievo. Thereupon Mr.
Harold W.&nbsp;E. Goad of the British-Italian League wrote a highly indignant
letter to the editor, and in the course of it he denounced me for having
egregiously invented the chocolates "for the sole purpose of throwing
her testimony into ridicule.... What do you, Sir, think of such methods
as that?" And he concluded by declaring that I wallowed in a "truly
Balkan slough of distortion and calumny." Well, on referring to Mrs.
Re-Bartlett's article I find that there is no mention of chocolates, and I
apologize; presumably the children were crowding round their adored
<i>Capitano</i> in order to thank him for the bridges and waterworks which
were being built in Dalmatia.</p></div>

doctors and priests were deported or expelled from the country, while
the Italian Government had to dissolve 30 municipal councils out of
33, so that at the head of the communes were Italian officials and
not properly elected mayors. Moreover, all liberties were suppressed.
No Slav newspapers, no Slav societies were permitted, and 32 out of
57 magistrates were dismissed&mdash;these methods being due not to cruelty
or folly, said the Professor, but to the necessity of keeping order by

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_61" id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> This, of course, did not meet with the approval of Signor d'Annunzio.
He made numerous pronouncements with regard to his inflexible desires,
saying that, if necessary, he would offer up his bleeding corpse. And
his resistance to the Italian Government did not confine itself to rhetoric.
During his usurpation of Rieka this man had done his country grievous
harm. It was not only that he held her up to the smiles of the malicious
who said that she could not keep order in her own house, but he was
guiding the people back to barbarism. When sailors of the royal navy
deserted to his standard, he knelt before them in the streets of Rieka at
a time when from Russia Lenin was inciting the Italian Communists to
revolution and to the conquest of the State. He refused to deal with
Giolitti, even as he had rejected the advances of Nitti. But the aged
Giolitti grasped the problem with more firmness, which was what one
might expect from the statesman who, after his return to power, had
leaned neither on the industrial magnates of Milan nor on their Bol&#353;evik
antagonists. Giolitti was resolved to put an end to the nuisance of
d'Annunzio; in no constitutional State is there room for a Prime Minister
and such a swashbuckler. The Nationalists of Italy were furious when
they perceived that the Premier was in earnest and that force would be
employed against their idol. And it had to come to that, for the utterly
misguided man continued to resist&mdash;hoping doubtless for wholesale
desertions in the army and navy&mdash;with the deplorable result that a good
many Italians were slain by Italians. Orders were issued by the Government
that all possible care should be taken of d'Annunzio's person; and
eventually when Rieka was taken by the royalist troops the poet broke
his oath that he would surely die; he announced that Italy was not
worth dying for and it was said that he had sailed away on an aeroplane.
He had accomplished none of his desires; the town had not become
Italian, though he had bathed it in Italian blood. His overweening
personal ambitions had been shipwrecked on the rock of ridicule, for as
he made his inglorious exit he shouted at the world that he was "still
alive and inexorable." But yet he may have unconsciously achieved
something, for his seizure of what he loved to call the "holocaust city"
provided the extreme Nationalists with a private stage where&mdash;in uniforms
of their own design, in cloaks and feathers and flowing black ties and
with eccentric arrangements of the hair&mdash;they could strut and caper
and fling bombastic insults at the authorities in Rome, until the Government
found it opportune to take them in hand. The greatest Italian
poet and one of the greatest imaginative writers in Europe will now be
able to devote himself&mdash;if his rather morbid Muse has suffered no injury&mdash;to
his predestined task. Those&mdash;the comparatively few that read&mdash;whose
acquaintance with this writer's work usually caused them to regret
his methods, could not help admiring his personal activities, his genius
for leadership and his vital fire during the War. But, once this was over,
he relapsed; and expressing himself very clearly in action, so that he
became known to the many instead of the few, he lived what he previously
wrote, and now it is generally recognized that Gabriel of the Annunciation,
as he calls himself, who produced a row of obscene and histrionic
novels, is a mountebank, a self-deceiver and a most affected bore. When
he came to Rieka he thought fit to appeal to the England of Milton.
And, like him, Milton lived as he wrote. Milton, Dante and Sophocles&mdash;to
mention no others of the supreme writers&mdash;were as serious and responsible
in their public actions as in the pursuit of their art.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> Whatever be the limitations of the <i>Dom</i> as a newspaper&mdash;it is almost
exclusively occupied with the person and programme of Mr. Radi&#263;&mdash;yet
that brings with it the virtue, most exceptional in Yugoslavia, of refusing
to engage in polemics. This would otherwise take up a good deal of its
space, as Radi&#263; has become such a bogey-man that nothing is too ridiculous
for his opponents to believe. A Czech newspaper not long ago informed
the world that this monstrous personage had told an interviewer that not
only had Serbian soldiers in Macedonia been murdering 200 children but
that they had roasted and consumed them. Furthermore Radi&#263; had
said that the British Minister to Yugoslavia had called upon him and
had asked his advice with some persistence, not even wishing to leave
Radi&#263; time to reflect, as to whether the Prince-Regent should rule in
Russia, while an English Prince should be invited to occupy the Yugoslav
throne. The first of these remarks proved conclusively, said a
number of Belgrade papers, that Radi&#263; was a knave and by the second
he had demonstrated that he was an imbecile. And my friend Mr.
Leiper of the <i>Morning Post</i> speculated as to whether he was more likely
to end his days in a lunatic asylum or a prison. But Radi&#263; was caring
about none of these things; his birthday happened at about this time
and some 30,000 of his adherents came to do him honour at his birthplace,
over 500 of them on decorated horses having met him at Sisak
station the previous evening. When I asked him what he had to say
about the two afore-mentioned remarks he gave me an amusing account
of how the interviewer had appreciated the various samples of wine
which he (Radi&#263;) had just brought down from his vineyard. The conversation
lasted for about four hours, and in the course of it Radi&#263; mentioned
that a certain Moslem deputy from Novi Bazar, irritated by
the fact that Mr. Dra&#353;kovi&#263;, Minister of the Interior, found no pleasure
in his continued presence on a commission of inquiry in the region of
Kossovo, had been throwing out very dark hints about a child which
he accused the Serbs of killing in the stormy days of 1878, and then
relating to the Tsar that this dastardly deed had been committed by the
Turks. This was the basis of that part of the interview. As for the
other absurdity, it was mentioned that some courtiers had told the
Prince-Regent that he alone could establish an orderly Government in
Russia, whereupon Radi&#263; observed that England and France were not
likely to allow one person to reign both there and in Yugoslavia. And
when I asked why he had not published this explanation in his paper,
he said that he couldn't very well charge a guest with having liked his
wine too much.</p></div>

<p class="section">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Nobody could have expected in the autumn of 1918
that the frontiers of the new State would be rapidly
delimitated. Ethnological, economic, historic and
strategical arguments&mdash;to mention no others&mdash;would be
brought forward by either side, and the Supreme Council,
which had to deliver judgment on these knotty problems,
would be often more preoccupied with their own interests
and their relation to each other. It would also happen
that a member of the Supreme Council would be simultaneously
judge and pleader. The mills of justice would
therefore grind very slowly, for they would be conscious
that the fruit of their efforts, evolved with much foreign
material clogging the machinery and with parts of the
machinery jerked out of their line of track, would be
received with acute criticism. When more than two
years had elapsed from the time of the Armistice a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
part of Yugoslavia's frontiers remained undecided.
We will travel along the frontier lines, starting
with that between Yugoslavs and Albanians.</p>


<p class="section">(a) THE ALBANIAN FRONTIER</p>

<p class="section">1. THE ACTORS</p>

<p>Those who in old Turkish days lived in that wild
border country which is dealt with on these pages would
have been surprised to hear that they would be the objects
of a great deal of discussion in the west of Europe. But
in those days there was no Yugoslavia and no Albania
and no League of Nations, and very few were the writers
who took up this question. It is, undoubtedly, a question
of importance, though some of these writers, remembering
that the fate of the world was dependent on the fraction
of an inch of Cleopatra's nose, seem almost to have
imagined that it was proportionately more dependent on
those several hundred kilometres of disputed frontier.
It would not so much matter that they have introduced
a good deal of passion into their arguments if they had
not also exerted some influence on influential men&mdash;and
this compels one to pay them what would otherwise be
excessive attention.</p>

<p>Let us consider the frontier which the Ambassadors'
Conference in November 1921 assigned to Yugoslavia and
the Albanians. We have already mentioned some of
the previous points of contact between those Balkan
neighbours who for centuries have been acquiring knowledge
of each other and who, therefore, as Berati Bey,
the Albanian delegate in Paris, very wisely said, should
have been left to manage their own frontier question. A
number of Western Europeans will exclaim that this
could not be accomplished without the shedding of blood;
but it is rather more than probable that the interference
of Western Europe&mdash;partly philanthropic and partly
otherwise&mdash;will be responsible for greater loss of life.
If it could not be permitted that two of the less powerful
peoples should attempt to settle their own affairs, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
at any rate, the most competent of alien judges should
have sat on the tribunal. A frontier in that part of
Europe should primarily take the peculiarities of the
people into account, and I believe that if Sir Charles Eliot
and Baron Nopsca with their unrivalled knowledge of the
Albanians had been consulted it is probable they would,
for some years to come, have thought desirable the frontier
which is preferred by General Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey, by a
majority of the local Albanians, and by those who hope
for peace in the Balkans.</p>


<p class="section">2. THE AUDIENCE RUSH THE STAGE</p>

<p>A battle which took place near Tuzi, not far from
Podgorica, in December 1919, may assist the study of
the difficult Albanian question. At the first attack
about 150 Montenegrins, mostly young recruits, were
killed or wounded; but in the counter-attack the Albanian
losses were much greater, 167 of them being made
prisoners. On all of these were found Italian rifles,
ammunition, money and army rations. On the other
hand, a few Montenegrins, with three officers, were also
captured and were stripped and handed over, naked, to
the Italians. But these declined to have them, saying
that the conflict had been no concern of theirs, and the
unfortunate men&mdash;with the exception of one who escaped&mdash;remained
among the Albanians. The fact that Tuzi
would be of no value to the Italians neither weakens
nor strengthens the supposition that they were privy
to the Albanian attack; but it may very well be that the
natives had taken their Italian equipment by force of
arms. It would, anyhow, seem that the Italians have
little understanding of this people: during the War,
when General Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey was straightening his
line, he paid some hundreds of Albanians to maintain
his western flank, and they were very satisfactory. (It
troubled them very little whether they were holding it
against the Austrians or against other Albanians.) When
Italy took over that part of the line she employed a whole
Division, which&mdash;to the amusement, it is said, of Franchet
d'Esp&eacute;rey&mdash;provided the local population with a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
deal of booty, and in particular with mules. There was
constant trouble in those regions of Albania which were
occupied by the Italians,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and in June 1920 things had
come to such a pass that the Italian garrisons, after being
thrown out of the villages of Bestrovo and Selitza, were
actually retiring with all the stores they could rescue to
Valona. Their retreat, said Reuter, in a euphemistic
message from Rome, was "attended by some loss." As
Valona was their last stronghold in Albanian territory,
it seemed that very few, if any, of the tribes were in
favour of an Italian protectorate. And since it was
calculated that during the first six months of 1920 the
Italian Government was paying from 400 to 500 million
lire a month for corn, and the year's deficit might be
enough to lead the State to the very verge of bankruptcy,
one was asking whether from an economic, apart from
any other, point of view, it would not be advisable for
the Italians to cut their losses in central Albania. And
this they very wisely determined to do. Would that
their subsequent policy in northern Albania had been
as well-inspired.</p>

<p>It would also seem as if the affair of Tuzi shows that
the Albanians have no wish for a Yugoslav protectorate,
and there are a good many Serbs, such as Professor
Cviji&#263;, who view with uneasiness any extension of their
sway over the Albanians. Many of the tribes are prepared,
after very small provocation or none, to take up
arms against anybody; and those who, in the north
and north-east of the country, are in favour of a Yugoslav
protectorate would undoubtedly have opposed to them
a number of the natives, less because they are fired with
the prospect of "Albania for the Albanians" than on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>account of their patriarchal views. We must, however,
at the same time, acknowledge that those Albanians
who are impelled by patriotic ideals, and who would
like to see their countrymen within the 1913 frontiers,
resolutely turn away from the various attractions which
the Slavs undoubtedly exercise over many of them and
combine in a brotherly fashion, under the guidance of a
disinterested State, to work for an independent Albania&mdash;those
idealists have every right to be heard. Their
solution is, in fact, the one that would, as we have elsewhere
said, be best for everyone concerned. The late
Professor Burrows, who believed in the possibility of such
an arrangement, thought that it would take generations
for this people "to pass from blood feud and tribal
jealousy to the good order of a unified State, unless they
have tutorage in the art of self-government." There
seem to be grave difficulties, both external and internal,
in the way of setting up such a tutorage over the whole
of the 1913 Albania; and if a majority of the northern
and north-eastern tribes prefer to turn to Yugoslavia,
rather than to join the frustrated patriots and the wilder
brethren in turning away from it, they should not be
sweepingly condemned as traitors to the national cause.
The frame of mind which looks with deep suspicion on a
road that links a tribe to its neighbour is not very promising
for those who dream of an Albanian nation; it is a
prevalent and fundamental frame of mind. "The Prince
of Wied," we are told by his countryman, Dr. Max M&uuml;ller,
"succeeded in conquering the hearts of those Albanians
who supported him and of gaining the highest respect
of those who were his political opponents." No doubt
they were flattered when they noticed that he had so far
become an Albanian as to surround his residence at
Durazzo with barbed-wire entanglements.</p>

<p>Among the solutions of the Albanian problem was that
which Dr. M&uuml;ller very seriously, not to say ponderously,
put forward in 1916.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This gentleman, with a first-hand
knowledge of the country, which he gained during
the War, did not minimize the task which would face
the Prince of Wied on his return. Of that wooden potentate
one may say that his work in Albania did not collapse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>for the reason that it was never started; a few miles
from Durazzo, his capital, from which, I believe, he
made only that one excursion whose end was undignified,
a few miles away he excited the derision of his "subjects,"
and a few miles farther off they had not heard of him.
Dr. M&uuml;ller, after reproving us sternly for smiling at the
national decoration, in several classes, with which his
Highness on landing at the rickety pier was graciously
pleased to gladden the meritorious natives, admits that
at his second coming he will have to take various other
steps. Austrians and Germans should be brought to
colonize the country, and not peasants, forsooth, like
those who have laboriously made good in the Banat,
but merchants, manufacturers, engineers, doctors, officials
and large landowners&mdash;not by any means without close
inquiry, so as to admit only such as are in possession of
a blameless repute and a certain amount of cash. Dr.
M&uuml;ller was resolved that, so far as lay with him, none
but the very best Teutons should embark upon this
splendid mission. He desired that, after landing, they
should first of all remain at the harbour, there to undergo
a course of tuition in the customs and peculiarities of
the tribe among which they proposed to settle. His
compatriots would be so tactful&mdash;apparently not criticizing
any of the customs&mdash;that the hearts of the Albanians
would incline towards them and by their beautiful
example they would make these primitive, wild hearts
beat not so much for local interests but very fervently
for the Albanian fatherland. One cannot help a feeling
of regret that circumstances have prevented us from
seeing Dr. M&uuml;ller's scheme put into action.</p>


<p class="section">3. SERBS, ALBANIANS AND THE MISCHIEF-MAKERS</p>

<p>In 1913, after the Balkan War, the flags of the Powers
were hoisted at Scutari, and a frontier dividing the
Albanians from the Yugoslavs (Montenegrins and Serbs)
was indicated by Austria and traced at the London
Conference. This boundary was still awaiting its final
demarcation by commissioners on the spot when the
European War broke out. Then in the second year of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the War disturbances were organized by the Austrians
in Albania&mdash;their friend the miscreant ruler of Montenegro
caused money to be sent for this purpose to the Austro-Hungarian
Consul at Scutari&mdash;and in April and May of
that year the Serbs were authorized by their Allies to
protect themselves by occupying certain portions of the
country. Various battles took place between those
Albanians who were partisans of Austria and those who
were disinclined to attack the Serbs in the rear. The
Serbian Government opposed the Austrian propaganda
by dispatching to that region the Montenegrin Pouni&#353;a
Ra&#269;i&#263;, of whom we have much to say. He was accompanied
by Smajo Ferovi&#263;, a Moslem sergeant of komitadjis.
They explained to the Albanians that the Serbs
had been offered a separate peace with numerous concessions,
but that Mr. Pa&#353;i&#263; had refused to treat. When
the two Albanian parties discussed the situation by
shooting at each other, the Austro-Hungarian officers
made tracks for Kotor, and that particular intrigue came
to an end.</p>

<p>When the War was over, the Serbs, sweeping up
from Macedonia, were requested by General Franchet
d'Esp&eacute;rey to undertake a task which the Italians refused,
and push the demoralized Austrian troops out of Albania.
Some weeks after this had been accomplished, the Italians,
mindful of the Treaty of London, demanded that a large
part of Albania should be given up to their administration.
The Serbs agreed and withdrew; they even took away
their representative from Scutari, where the Allies had
again installed themselves. The Treaty of London bestowed
upon the Serbs a sphere of influence in northern
Albania, but&mdash;save for a few misguided politicians&mdash;they
were logical enough to reject the whole of the pernicious
Treaty, both the clauses which robbed them in Dalmatia
and those which in Albania gave them stolen goods.
Over and over again did the Yugoslav delegates declare
in Paris that it was their wish to see established an
independent Albania with the frontiers of 1913. These,
the first frontiers which the Albanians had ever possessed,
were laid down by Austria with the express purpose of
thwarting the Serbs and facilitating Albanian raids. It
is true that several towns with large Albanian majorities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
were made over to the Serbs&mdash;very much, as it turned
out, to their subsequent advantage&mdash;yet, being separated
from their hinterland, this was a doubtful gift. Nevertheless,
if a free and united Albania could be constituted
the Serbs were ready to accept this frontier, and even
Monsieur Justin Godart, the strenuous French Albanophile
of whom we speak elsewhere, cannot deny that this
attitude of the Yugoslavs redounds very much to their
honour. But before relative tranquillity reigns among
the Albanians it is, as General Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey perceived
in 1918, an untenable line. He, therefore, drew a
temporary frontier which permitted the Serbs to advance
for some miles into Albania, so that on the river Drin or
on the mountain summits they might ward off attacks.
These, by the way, had their origin far more in the border
population's empty stomachs than in their animus against
the Slavs. And nobody with knowledge of this people
could regard the 1918 frontier as unnecessary. The
Albanians were themselves so much inclined to acquiesce
that one must ask why, in the months which followed,
there was a considerable amount of border fighting.
What was it that caused the Albanians in the region of
Scutari to make their violent onslaughts of December
1919 and January 1920, the renewed offensive of July
1920 at the same places&mdash;after which the Albanian
Government forwarded to that of Belgrade an assurance
of goodwill&mdash;and the organized thrust of August 13 against
Dibra, which was preceded on August 10 by a manifesto
to the chancelleries of Europe falsely accusing the
Serbs of having begun these operations, and which was
followed by the Tirana Government promising to try to
find the guilty persons? The 19th of the same month
saw the Albanians delivering a further attack in the
neighbourhood of Scutari, and then the Yugoslav Government
decided that their army must occupy such defensive
positions as would put a stop to these everlasting incidents.
But a voice was whispering to the Albanians
that they must not allow themselves to be so easily
coerced. "You have thrown us out of all the land behind
Valona," said the voice, "and out of Valona itself. You
must, therefore, be the greatest warriors in the world,
and we will be charmed to provide you with rifles and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
machine guns and munitions and uniforms and cash.
We will gladly publish to the world that your Delegation
at Rome has sent us an official Note demanding that the
Yugoslav troops should retire to the 1913 line, pure and
simple. Of course we, like the other Allies, agreed that
they should occupy the more advanced positions which
General Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey assigned to them&mdash;and to
show you how truly sorry we are for having done so, we
propose to send you all the help you need. In dealing
with us you will find that you have to do with honourable
men, whereas the Yugoslavs&mdash;what are they but Yugoslavs?"</p>

<p>Anyone who travelled about this time along the road
from Scutari down to the port of San Giovanni di Medua
would inevitably meet with processions of ancient cabs,
ox-wagons and what not, laden with all kinds of military
equipment. Some of these supplies had come direct
from Italy, while others had been seized from the Italians
near Valona. The detachment of Italian soldiers at San
Giovanni, and the much larger detachment at Scutari,
may have looked with mixed feelings at some of these
commodities, but on the other hand they may have
thought, with General Bencivenga,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that it was good
business&mdash;"<i>un buon affare</i>"&mdash;in exchange for Valona to
obtain a solid and secure friendship with the Albanians.
Roads, as he pointed out, lead from Albania to the heart
of Serbia, and for that reason a true brotherhood of arms
between Italians and Albanians was, in case of hostilities,
enormously to be desired. And so the Italians stationed
at Scutari, under Captain Pericone of the Navy, may
have felt that it was well that all those cannon captured
from their countrymen were in such a good condition.
They would now be turned by the Albanians against the
hateful Yugoslavs. ["Italy is the one Power in Europe,"
says her advocate, Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Goad, in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> (May 1922), "that is most obviously and most consistently
working for peace and conciliation in every field."] ...
A further supply of military material is said to have
reached the Albanians from Gabriele d'Annunzio in the
<small>s.s.</small> <i>Knin</i>. To the Irish, the Egyptians and the Turks
the poet-filibuster had merely sent greetings. Some one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>may have told him that even the most lyrical greeting
would not be valued by the Albanians half as much as a
shipload of munitions.</p>

<p>For a considerable time the more intelligent Italians
had noticed that these two Balkan peoples were disposed
to live in amicable terms with one another. Traditions
that are so powerful with an illiterate people&mdash;under
five per thousand of the Albanians who have stayed in
their own country can read and write&mdash;numerous traditions
speak of friendship with the Serbs: Lek, the great
legislator, was related to Serbian princes; Skanderbeg
was an ally of the Serbs; "Most of the celebrated
leaders of northern Albania and Montenegro," says
Miss Durham, "seem to have been of mixed Serbian-Albanian
blood"; Mustapha Vezir Bushatli strove
together with Prince Milo&#353; against the Turks, and the
same cause united the Serbian authorities to the famous
Vezir Mahmud Begovi&#263; of Pe&#263;. A primitive people like
the Albanians admire the warlike attributes beyond all
others, and the exploits of the Serbian army in the
European War inclined the hearts of the Albanians
towards their neighbours. Some of them remembered
at this juncture that their great-grandfathers or grandfathers
had only become Albanian after having accepted
the Muhammedan religion; now the old ikons were
taken from their hiding-places. And there was, in fact,
between the two Balkan people a spirit of cordiality which
gave terrible umbrage to the Italians. So they took the
necessary steps: many of the Catholic priests had been
in Austria's pay, and these now became the pensioners
of Italy. Monsignor Sereggi, the Metropolitan, used to
be anti-Turk but, as was evident when in 1911 he negotiated
with Montenegro, he is not personally anti-Slav.
Yet he must have money for his clergy, for his seminary,
and so forth. His friendship would be easily, one fancies,
transferred from Rome to Belgrade if the Serbs are
willing to provide the cash&mdash;and nobody can blame him.
Leo Freund, who had been Vienna's secret agent and a
great friend of Monsignor Bum&ccedil;i, the Albanian bishop,
was succeeded by an Italian. But, of course, the new
almoner did not confine his gifts to those of his own faith.
Many of the leading Moslems were in receipt of a monthly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
salary, and this was not so serious a burden for the
Italians as one might suppose, since Albania is a poor
country, and with no Austrian competition you found
quite prominent personages deigning to accept a rather
miserable wage. "And do you think," I asked of Musa
Yuka, the courteous mayor of Scutari, "that those
mountain tribes are being paid?" "Well," he said, "I
think that it is not improbable." ... At the time of the
Bosnian annexation crisis the Serbs had as their Minister
of Finance the sagacious Patcho&ugrave;. The War Minister,
a General, was strongly in favour of an instant declaration
of war, and the Premier suggested that the matter
should be discussed. He turned to the Minister of
Finance and asked him whether he had sufficient money
for such an undertaking. Patcho&ugrave; shook his head.
"But our men are patriots! They will go without
bread, they will go without everything!" exclaimed the
General. "The horses and mules are not patriots,"
said Patcho&ugrave;, "and if you want them to march you'll
have to feed them." The Albanians were so little inclined
to go to war with Yugoslavia that the Italians
had, in various ways, to feed them nearly all. And what
did the Albanians think of these intrigues? At any
rate, what did they say? "Italy," quoth Professor
Chimig&ograve;,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> a prominent Albanian who teaches at Bologna,
"Italy is always respected and esteemed as a great
nation.... The Albanian Government," said he, "has
charged me to declare in public that Albania does not
regard herself as victorious against Italy, but is convinced
that the Italians, in withdrawing their troops
from Valona, were obeying a sentiment of goodness and
generosity." Such words would be likely to bring more
plentiful supplies from Rome. And fortunately the
Italians did not seem to suffer, like the Serbs, from any
scruples as to the propriety of taking active steps against
another "Allied and Associated Power." When Zena
Beg Riza Beg of Djakovica came in the year 1919 to his
brother-in-law Ahmed Beg Mati, one of the Albanian
leaders, he told him that the Belgrade Government, in
pursuance of their policy "The Balkans for the Balkan
peoples," would be glad if the Italians could be ousted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>from Albania. Zena Beg returned with a request for
money, guns and so forth; but they were not sent.</p>

<p>Ahmed Beg and Zena Beg are patriotic young Albanian
noblemen of ancient family and great possessions. But
Zena Beg has the advantage of living in Yugoslavia,
outside the atmosphere of corruption which is darkening
his native land. Ahmed Beg, who in 1920 was Minister
of the Interior, Minister of War, Governor of Scutari
and Director (in mufti) of the military operations against
the Yugoslavs, did not accept Italian bribes, but he was
surrounded by those who did, and thus the gentle and
industrious young man was being led to work against
his own country's interests. With him at Scutari was
another of the six Ministers of the Tirana Government,
in the person of the venerable Moslem priest Kadri,
Minister of Justice, and one of the four Regents, Monsignor
Bum&ccedil;i. There was about it all an Oriental odour
of the less desirable kind, which caused some observers
to say that when Albania obtains her independence she
will be a bad imitation of the old Turkey&mdash;a little Turkey
without the external graces. When the thoughtful greybeard
Kadri went limping down the main street, a protecting
gendarme dawdled behind him, smoking a
cigarette; but this endearing nonchalance was absent
from the methods of government: any Albanian whose
opinions did not coincide with those of the authorities
could only express them at his peril. [Blood-vengeance
is, to some extent, being deposed by party-vengeance&mdash;this
having originated in the time of Wied, when the
politicians were divided into Nationalists and Essadists,
after which they became Italophils and Austrophils,
who now have been succeeded by Italophils (who ask
for an Italian mandate) and Serbophils and Grecophils
(who desire that these countries should have no mandate,
but should act in a friendly spirit towards an independent
Albania). Meanwhile the Italophils, nearly all of them
on Italy's pay-roll, were, till a few months ago, in the
ascendant, and their attitude towards the other party
was relentless.] One Alush Ljocha, for example, said
that he thought it would be well if Yugoslavia and
Albania lived on friendly terms with one another.
Because of this&mdash;the Government having adopted other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
ideas&mdash;his house at Scutari was burned,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and when we
were discussing the matter at the palace of the Metropolitan,
Monsignor Sereggi, I found that His Grace was
emphatically in accord with a fiery Franciscan poet,
Father Fichta, with the more placid Monsignor Bum&ccedil;i,
and with two other ecclesiastics who were present. "We
did well to burn his house, very well, I say!" exclaimed
Father Fichta, "because Alush is only a private person
and he has no business to concern himself with foreign
countries." Of course, when Father Fichta made his
comments on foreign countries it was not as a private
person but as a responsible editor. Thus in the <i>Posta e
Shqypnis</i> during the War he denounced Clemenceau and
Lloyd George as such foes of humanity that their proper
destination was a cage of wild beasts, and, after having
visited France during 1919 as secretary to the sincere
and credulous Bum&ccedil;i, he contributed anti-French and,
I believe, anti-English poems to the <i>Epopea Shqyptare</i>.</p>

<p>"I have been told," I said, "by an intelligent Albanian
who was educated at Robert College at Constantinople
that the greatest hope for the country lies, in his opinion,
in the increase of American schools, such as that one
at Elbasan and the admirable institution at Samakoff
in Bulgaria, where the Americans&mdash;in order not to be
accused of proselytism&mdash;teach everything except
religion."</p>

<p>"If I had my own way," cried Fichta, "I would
shut up these irreligious American schools. Religion is
the base of the social life of this country."</p>

<p>"And you and the Muhammedans," I asked, "do
you think that your co-operation has a good prospect
of enduring? With a country of no more than one and
a half million inhabitants it is essential that you should
be united."</p>

<p>"God in Heaven! Who can tolerate such things?"
exclaimed the Metropolitan. That very corpulent old
gentleman was bouncing with rage on his sofa. "Is it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>not horrible," he cried in Italian, "that this man should
dare to come to my house and make propaganda against
us?"</p>

<p>"Really, sir, I am astonished," said Monsignor
Bum&ccedil;i, reproachfully, in French, "that you should ask
such a question." [It was answered a few weeks later,
when Halim Beg Derala and Zena Beg&mdash;who, being outside
Albania, were free to utter non-Governmental
opinions&mdash;said that they had not the slightest doubt
but that the friendship between the fanatic Moslem and
the fanatic Catholic would come to an end and each of
them would again in the first place think of his religion,
so that, as heretofore, they would regard themselves as
Turkish and Latin people rather than as Albanian. This
foible does not apply to the Orthodox Albanians of the
South, who are more patriotic.] "I am astonished," said
the Monsignor, "that you should question our friendship
with the Moslem. They have been the domineering
party, but all that is finished, and we are the best of
friends. See, they have chosen me to be one of the
Regents!<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Our Government of all the three religions is
very good, and," said he, as he thumped the arm of his
chair, "it insists on the Albanians obtaining justice in
spite of our enemies."</p>

<p>It chanced that I had met Father Achikou, Doctor
of Theology and Philosophy, in the Franciscan church.
Because his brother had had occasion to kill an editor
in self-defence, this, perhaps the most enlightened,
member of the Albanian Catholic clergy, had been compelled
to remain for eight months in the church and its
precincts, seeing that the Government was powerless to
guarantee that he would not be overtaken by that national
curse, the blood-vengeance.</p>

<p>"Well, one cannot praise the custom of blood-vengeance,"
said the Monsignor.</p>

<p>"You spoke," I said, "of your Government insisting
on justice for the Albanians."</p>

<p>And some time after this Professor Achikou and another
prominent young priest were deported to Italy
and, I believe, interned in that country.... With their
fate we may compare that of Dom Ndoc Nikai, a priest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>whose anti-Slav paper, the <i>Bessa Shqyptare</i>, is alleged to
exist on its Italian subsidy, and Father Paul Doday,
whom Italy insisted on installing as Provincial of all
the Franciscans (after vetoing at Rome the appointment
of Father Vincent Pr&ecirc;nnushi, whom nearly all the
Franciscans in Albania had voted for). Father Doday,
it is interesting to note, is of Slav nationality, for he
comes from Janjevo in Kossovo, but he studied in Italy,
and has abandoned the ways of his ancestors. This
town of some 500 houses, inhabited by Slavs from Dalmatia
and a few Saxons who are now entirely Slavicized,
still retains a costume that resembles the Dalmatian, as
also a rather defective Dalmatian dialect. The Austrians
for thirty years endeavoured to Albanize them, but the
people resisted this and boycotted the church and school.
The priest Lazar, who defended their Slav national
conscience, was persecuted and forced to flee to Serbia&mdash;he
is now Mayor of Janjevo. It usually happened, by
the way, that the priests of this Catholic town came from
Dalmatia; but the Slav idea could bridge over the
difference between Catholicism and Orthodoxy, so that
if no Catholic priest was available his place would
be taken by an Orthodox priest from a neighbouring
village. Only a few of the natives are anti-nationalists,
having been brought up, like Father Doday, in some
Italian or Austrian seminary. There are in Albania
to-day about ten such priests who come from Janjevo....
How well this Father Doday has served his masters
may be seen in the case of the Franciscan priest in Shala,
who, with the whole population of armed Catholics,
resisted the Italian advance of 1920. Together with
Lieut. Lek Marashi he organized komitadjis in Shala and
elsewhere, his purpose being to liberate his country from
the Italians. Since these latter could do nothing else
against him they compelled the Bishop of Pulati to
punish him; however, all that the Bishop did was to tell
the patriot priest to go away. But Father Doday was
more willing to work for the Italians; he excommunicated
his fellow-countryman, on the ground that he would
not come to Scutari, where his life would have been in
danger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">4. THE STATE OF ALBANIAN CULTURE</p>

<p>But, you may say, one cannot in fairness expect the
new Albanian Government to achieve in so short a time
what the Serbian Government has effected among the
Albanians of Kossovo, who are being persuaded to
relinquish their devastating custom of blood-vengeance.
Prior to March 1921, over 400 of its devotees and of
brigands had given themselves up in Kossovo&mdash;turning
away from the old days when, as one of them expressed it,
"a shot from my rifle was heard at a distance of three
hours' travel"; one of the most eminent among them
disdained to surrender to a local authority and made
his way to Belgrade, where he presented himself one
afternoon to the astonished officials at the Ministry of the
Interior. "After all," as Miss Durham has written, "the
most important fact in northern Albania is blood-vengeance."
What we must set out to probe is whether
the Albanians, if they are left to themselves, will be able
after a time to administer their country in a reasonably
satisfactory manner.... Their culture is admittedly a
very low one. In the realm of art a few love-songs
and several proverbs were all that Consul Hahn could
collect for his monumental work,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> though his researches,
which lasted for years, took him all over the country.
One of these love-songs, a piece of six lines, will give some
idea of their &aelig;sthetic value; a lover, standing outside
the house of his lady, invites her to come out to him
immediately; he threatens that if she disobeys him he
will have his hair cut in the Western style, nay more, he
will have it washed and then he will return, howling like
a dog. Consul Hahn's summing up of the Albanians,
by the way, stated that the social life of C&aelig;sar's <i>Bellum
Gallicum</i> was applicable to the tribes which now inhabit
southern Albania, those of the north not being
equal to so high a standard. Yastrebow, the well-known
Russian Consul-General, tells us of the villages of Retsch
and Tschidna, where in winter men and women clothe
themselves with rags, in summer with no rags&mdash;so that
in the warmer months a visitor, presumably, in order not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>to shock the natives, would take the precaution of depositing
his clothes in some convenient cavern. On the other
hand, when the ladies in waiting on the Princess of Wied
drove out in low-cut dresses, it being warm weather, the
people of Durazzo were scandalized at what they called
the terrible behaviour of their Prince's harem. These
mountain people live on maize and milk and cheese&mdash;salt
is unknown to them. Baron Nopsca is regarded
by the few educated Albanians as the most competent
foreign observer. He knew the language well and
travelled everywhere. One custom he relates of the
Merturi is the sprinkling of ashes on a spot where they
suspect that treasure is buried; on the next morning
they look to see what animal has left on the ashes the
print of its feet, and this tells them what sacrifice the
guardian of the treasure demands&mdash;sheep or hen or
human being. Miss Durham says that human excrement
and water is the sole emetic known to the Albanians;
it is used in all cases of poisoning. But the Albanian's
death is most frequently brought about by gun-shot.
"In Toplana," as they say, "people are killed like pigs"&mdash;42
per cent. of the adults, according to Nopsca, dying
a violent death. "It was her good government and her
orderliness that obtained for her her admission to the
League of Nations," said the Hon. Aubrey Herbert, M.P.,
in the <i>Morning Post</i> of November 29, 1921. And the
enthusiastic President of the Anglo-Albanian Society is
modest enough to refrain from telling us how much she
was indebted to his own championship. The evil eye is
feared in Albania more than syphilis or typhus. Siebertz<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
mentions a favourite remedy, which is to spit at the
patient. A ceremonial spitting is also used by anyone
who sees two people engaged in close conversation; very
likely they are plotting against the third party, and by
his timely expectoration their wicked plans will be
upset.</p>

<p>Absurd as it may sound, there are not a few Albanian
apologists who lay the entire blame upon the Turks.
They assert&mdash;and it is true&mdash;that Constantinople left this
distant province so completely almost to its own devices
that the suzerain might just as well not have existed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>A few Turkish officials lived in the towns, in the country
they showed themselves when they were furtively
travelling through it; and the chief officials, such as the
Vali of Scutari, were wont to be Albanians. And, being
left by the Turks to evolve their own salvation, they
turned Albania into a region of utter darkness&mdash;at any
rate, they did practically nothing to shake off the barbarism
which they had inherited. They have certain
alluring attributes, such as their unpolluted medi&aelig;val
ideas on the sanctity of guests and the punctilious maintenance
of their honour,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> their readiness to die for freedom
as well as for a quarrel about a sheep, and their not infrequent
personal magnetism. They are very abstemious,
their morals are pure, they have certain mental qualities,
as yet undeveloped, and they are thrifty. But "they
are so devoid of both originality and unity," says Sir
Charles Eliot,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that acutest of observers, "that it is vain
to seek for anything in politics, art, religion, literature
or customs to which the name Albanian can be properly
applied as denoting something common to the Albanian
race."</p>

<p>The apologists, such as Miss Durham, argue that the
other Balkan peoples suffered from a good deal of internal
tumult after they had set themselves up as independent
countries. And it is submitted that the Albanians would
gradually develop the same national spirit as their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>neighbours. But there are as yet, Miss Durham must
acknowledge, very few signs that this will ever come to
pass.</p>

<p>"We are Albanians," said Monsignor Bum&ccedil;i, "we
ask for Albania! We demand it! Surely you can see
that we are all marching together, men from all parts of
Albania, marching against the Yugoslavs. I say we are
united."</p>

<p>And some miles from Scutari a part of the Albanian
army was returning from a foray into Yugoslavia. When
they came into the territory of a certain tribe they were
compelled, by way of toll, to surrender their booty. Such
incidents occurred in several places, so that obviously
the conditions still prevail that were described in 1905
by Karl Steinmetz,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> an Austrian engineer who learned
the language and travelled through the country in the
disguise of a Franciscan monk. "The tribes cannot
conceive the idea of a higher unity," says he in one of
his valuable books. [So that in attempting to build up
the new State these tribal institutions should be used as
much as possible. Except in the towns, which play a
relatively small part in the country's life, the voting
should be by tribes.] "How could a Nikaj and a Shala
meet," says he, "except for mutual destruction? Will
a Mirdite for a nice word give up his bandit expeditions
to the plain? The local antagonisms are as yet far too
great." More often than not you would find that the
Albanians regard each other as at the time of the Balkan
War, when, for example, a Serbian cavalry officer took the
village of Puka and asked the mayor to lead him to the
neighbouring village of Duci. His worship consented,
but after walking on ahead for half an hour he stopped.
"We are now midway between the two villages," he said,
"and I can go no farther." "Unless you continue,"
said the captain, "I shall be obliged to have you shot."
"<i>Nukahaile</i> [I don't care]," said the Albanian. "It is
all the same to me whether I am killed by you or by the
men of Duci, and I certainly shall be killed if I show
myself there."</p>

<p>"We are all united, Catholic and Moslem. It is
splendid!" said Monsignor Bum&ccedil;i. "And we are not by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>any means fanatical&mdash;with us it is the country first and
our religion afterwards."</p>

<p>Certainly the Shqyptar is not so good a churchman
as we have sometimes been led to believe. Prenk Bib
Doda is said to have cherished the precepts of the Catholic
Church with such devotion that he could not bring himself
to institute divorce proceedings against his childless
wife. We are told that his mother was animated with
similar scruples, and that, to solve this awkward question
the old lady one day seized a rifle and shot her daughter-in-law
dead. There is not more truth in this tale than
in that of the brigands who, on a certain Friday, overpowered
and slew a caravan of merchants between Dibra
and Prizren. On examining their spoil they are said to
have discovered a large amount of meat, but, as it was
Friday, to have refrained from consuming it. Prenk Bib
Doda was, as a matter of fact, impotent; and his widow,
Lucia Bib Doda, survives him.... One agrees with
Monsignor Bum&ccedil;i that the Albanian is not altogether so
blindly a supporter of his Church as we have been told,
and his murderous intentions against a neighbouring
tribe will be not at all diminished if they happen to profess
the same religion as himself.</p>

<p>"Anyone can see," quoth the Monsignor, "that the
Government is dear to us. Men are coming from all over
the country, anxious to execute its wishes and to be enrolled
against the Yugoslav."</p>

<p>Yes, we saw numbers of men tramping up to Scutari,
from boys to septuagenarians. They were going to
fight&mdash;it pleased them enormously. But if the Tirana
Government had ordered them to go back and work on
their fields, if it had asked them to take some precautions
against the ravages of syphilis, if it had expressed the
hope that they would no longer sell their women for an
old Martini, or that the village prefects would pay some
regard to sanitary matters&mdash;in the whole of Albania,
says Siebertz, there is only one <small>w.c.</small>&mdash;then they would
have laughed at this Government which tried to lay a
hand on their ancestral liberties.</p>

<p>"The end of it all is," said the Monsignor, "we
are Albanians. We demand the independence of our
country."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"As a Latin," writes Professor Katarani,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> "I was
fire and flame for Albania.... But after a few months
I was forced not only to change my views about them,
but to regret all that I had written in the <i>Mattino</i> and the
<i>Tribuna</i>.... They are not a people, but tribes ...
they are against every principle of public officials, they
live the most primitive lives. I who know Albania
from end to end, who have sacrificed myself for that
country, am absolutely convinced that there could be no
greater misfortune than if, in its present state, it were
given autonomy or independence. Otherwise I confess
that an Albania free from any foreign Power would be
to the interest of Italy." And he concludes by saying
that the Albanians have done nothing to deserve an
independent State. It is well known that in the Albanian
Societies that after May 1913 were engaged at Constantinople
and Sofia, at Rome and Vienna, in striving
for the independence of the country it was not the
Albanians themselves who had the chief word. Those
who were initiated into secret Balkan policies were aware
that Albania was the domain with which Article 7 of
the old Triple Alliance was concerned.... The fiery
Albanian patriot, Basri Bey, Prince of Dukagjin, also
agrees that in the beginning an independent Albania
would be productive of anarchy. "I greatly regret to
acknowledge it," says he,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> "but Albania is, so to speak,
the classic type of a country which has never had a real
government." Nevertheless, he is strongly in favour of
independence, his reasons being because Albania is "at
the same time the old mother and the youngest daughter
of the Balkans." This flamboyant prince and doctor
and deputy who denounces both Essad Pasha and his
nephew Ahmed Beg Mati, has got his own panacea for
the country, which is a Turkish army of occupation
commanded by a French general. Basri Bey seems to
confirm the remarks of his more enlightened co-religionists,
Halim Beg Derala and Zena Beg, for whereas the
Moslems can claim no more than a rather larger third of
the inhabitants, he calmly assumes that the whole country
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>is Moslem. Albania, he says, is now more than ever
attached to Turkey, for the attachment is purely moral.
... The influence of this gentleman seems to be confined
to Dibra, but he has a good opinion of his own importance.
In 1915, in the days of the greatness of Essad
Pasha, he set up a Government at Dibra with himself
as Prime Minister and Essad Pasha as his Minister of
the Interior! There does not seem to be much justification
for Basri Bey to call himself a prince. He is a
Pomak, for his ancestors were Bulgars who accepted
Islam. His father was an official of the Turkish Government
at Philippopolis.</p>

<p>Father Fichta told me that his countrymen would do
very well indeed if they could import from other parts
of Europe financial help, technicians and judges. Some
years ago the Turks settled to send two judges to Scutari;
then the Albanians would no longer be able to charge
them with not administering the law, so that each man
was obliged to take it into his own hands. "It is
entirely your fault," said the Albanians, "that we are
driven to adopt the method of blood-vengeance." So
thoroughly did they adopt it that the assassinations in
the region of Prizren, Djakovica and Pe&#263; amounted,
according to Gl&uuml;ck, to a total of about six hundred a
year. The Turks therefore sent a couple of judges to
Scutari, and on the day after their arrival they were
murdered.</p>

<p>What memory have the Albanians of their own great
men? One sultry afternoon, as we were driving in a
mule cart from the quaint town of Alessio, the driver
lashed his mule with a long stick; but after half a mile
of this, the animal applied a hind-leg sharply to the
driver's mouth. He roared and fell back in our arms
and bled profusely and was doctored by the fierce
gendarme, who put a handful of tobacco on the wound,
so that the driver had to keep his mouth shut. For the
remainder of the afternoon our mule went at a walking
pace, and presently, to while away the time, we begged
the gendarme and a merchant of Alessio, who was travelling
with us, to repeat the song of some old hero, such as
Skanderbeg. They stared&mdash;their mouths were also shut.
And finally the gendarme said he knew a hero-song. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
dealt with Zeph, a man with sheep, and Mark who stole
them. "Give me back my sheep," said Zeph. "No,
no!" said Mark. "Beware!" said Zeph. And one day,
as he hid behind a wall, he fired at Mark and slew him.
"That is the song," said the gendarme, "about the hero
Zeph."</p>

<p>To whatever state of culture the Albanians may climb,
I think it will be generally agreed that some r&eacute;gime
other than unaided independence must, in the meantime,
be established there. One hears of those who argue that
Albania should forthwith be for the Albanians, because
they are a gifted and a very ancient people. They are
not more gifted than the Basques, and their antiquity is
not more wonderful. Nor do they stand on a higher
level of culture with respect to their neighbours than do
the Basques as compared with theirs. Not many tears
are shed by the Basques or by anyone else because those
interesting men are all the subjects of France or Spain.</p>


<p class="section">5. A METHOD THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRIED IN
ALBANIA</p>

<p>If only the Albanian question would be taken in
hand by humanitarians.... Here you have one and a
half million of wild children.... Build them schools
and roads, police their country&mdash;they themselves agree
that the savage atmosphere in the northern mountains
was radically altered by the Austrians when they occupied
that country during the War. One has heard of numerous
philanthropic societies in Great Britain whose object
has been more remote and less deserving; if some such
society would turn to Albania, their educational and
economic labours might, after a time, be made self-supporting
by the permission to exploit&mdash;of course, with
due regard to Albania's future&mdash;the forests and mines.
"To be master in Albania," says M. Gabriel Hanotaux,
"one would have to dislodge the inhabitants from their
eyries"&mdash;(another French statesman has used a less
exalted simile: "Albania," M. Briand once said, "is
an international lavatory")&mdash;and it goes without saying
that any corporation which undertakes to civilize the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Shqyptart would need to bring in a military force, on
similar lines to the Swedish <i>gendarmerie</i> in Persia. The
Swedes, in fact, who are a military nation, might be
glad to accept this mandate; the expenses could be
met by an international fund. A certain number
of Albanians would be admitted to the <i>gendarmerie</i>;
and the more unruly natives would be dealt with
as they were, for everybody's good, by Austria....
The Yugoslavs would then be delighted to accept the
1913 frontier, which is also what the Albanians ask for;
and Yugoslavs, Italians and Greeks would all retire
from Albania. There is really no need for the Italians
to demand Valona or Saseno, the island which lies in
front of it. The Italian naval experts know very well
that the possession of Pola, Lussin and Lagosta would
not be made more valuable by the addition of an Albanian
base.</p>


<p class="section">6. THE ATTRACTION OF YUGOSLAVIA</p>

<p>But as Europe has not arrived at some such solution,
and since the Albanian Government has been prematurely
recognized by the Powers, then while the Albanians are
engaged in the stormy process of working out their own
salvation, it is only fair that Yugoslavia should be given
a good defensive frontier. The 1913 frontier is only
possible if the Albanians are pacific, but as it has now
been thought wise to set up an unaided and independent
Albanian State there is nothing more certain than the
turmoil of which its borders will be the scene, and this
will be so whether the Italians do or do not come to
the Albanians' assistance. What hope is there of even
a relative tranquillity on the Albanian border when so
many of the natives, preferring Yugoslav rule to that of
their own countrymen, will be waging a civil war? That
this preference is fairly widespread one could see in 1920
by the number of refugees on the Yugoslav side of the
frontier. [Of course, a large number of Albanians also
fled to Scutari and elsewhere from the districts lately
occupied by the Yugoslav army. In both cases the
refugees were moved sometimes by hopes for a brighter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
future, sometimes by fears which were caused by their
clouded past. To speak first of those who fled on account
of a guilty conscience, it is evident that these were more
numerous among the refugees in Albania than among
those in Yugoslavia, for it was the Yugoslav authorities
and not the Albanian who extended their sway. Mr.
Aubrey Herbert, M.P., wrote<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> "that in the North the
Yugoslavs had destroyed more than 120 Albanian
villages." It would have been interesting if he had given
us their names, because the Yugoslavs appear to have
set about it so thoroughly that one cannot find anything
like that number on the Austrian maps, which are the
best pre-war maps for those regions. The Anglo-Albanian
Society tells the British public, in November,
1920, of the 30,000 destitute refugees in Albania, and
in such a way that the cause of their exodus is ascribed,
without more ado, to the terrible Yugoslav. But as the
names are known of a good many Albanians who did
not wait for the Yugoslav army, on account of past
troubles between themselves and Yugoslavs, as also
between themselves and other Albanians, it would have
been as well if the Anglo-Albanian Society had reminded
the public that all who fly in those parts are not angels.
It would, on the other hand, be just as rash to sing the
undiluted praise of those Albanians who, at odds with
the Tirana Government, thought it opportune to leave
their native land; but one can safely say, I think, that
among these wanderers there was a larger proportion of
laudable men....] Yugoslavia attracts the Albanians
for more than one reason&mdash;not so much because the
ancestors of many of these Muhammedan Albanians
were, and not so long ago, Christians, as because inclusion
in Yugoslavia would be to their economic advantage&mdash;Scutari
can scarcely exist without the Yugoslav hinterland,
while the people of the mountains are longing for
that railway which the Yugoslavs will only build over
land which is moderately immune from depredation.
Other causes which have made so many of the borderland
Albanians&mdash;to speak only of them&mdash;turn their eyes
to Yugoslavia are the admiration which any primitive
people feels for military prowess and the knowledge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>what has taken place in the Prizren-Pe&#263;-Djakovica
region since it came into possession of the Serbs in 1913.
Let us in the first place see what sentiments are now
entertained by the Albanian natives of that region towards
their rulers. It goes without saying that these
sentiments are perfectly well known to those Albanians
who live outside the Yugoslav frontier.</p>

<p>Well, at Suva Rieka, near Prizren, for example, I
found that all the Muhammedan inhabitants of Serbian
origin are aware that they used to celebrate the Serbian
national custom of "Slava," still keep up the Serbian
Christmas Eve customs and often practise the old Christian
nine days' wailing for the dead. Some of us may think
that this new pro-Serbian tendency is rather on account
of utilitarian reasons; the great thing is that it should
exist. With rare exceptions, the people of Suva Rieka
used to live by plunder; now they are sending their
children to the Serbian school, at any rate the boys,
and for the study of religion the authorities have made
arrangements with a local Moslem. It is to be regretted
that Miss Edith Durham, whose writings were so pleasant
in the days before she became a more uncompromising
pro-Albanian than most of the Albanian leaders, says
that if these children go to Serbian schools it merely
shows to what lengths of coercion the Serbs will resort.
In 1912-1913 Serbian and Montenegrin officers seem to
have told her that severe measures would be employed
against any recalcitrant Albanian parent who might
decline to send his son to school. Assuming that these
officers were not young subalterns, that they were quite
sober and that they were not rudely "pulling Miss
Durham's leg," it may be urged that even if the children
be driven to school at the point of the bayonet, such
conduct would compare favourably with that of the
Albanians towards the Serbs in Turkish times. Talking
of coercion, I suppose that the progress in agricultural
methods which one sees around Prizren is only further
evidence of Serbian tyranny. The <i>gendarmerie</i> on the
country roads is composed largely of Muhammedan
Albanians&mdash;doubtless the Serbs have coerced them by
some horrible threats. And if Miss Durham were to hear
that Ramadan (<i>n&eacute;</i> Stojan) Stefanovi&#263; of the village of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Musotisti had decided to return to the Orthodox faith
to which his brothers George and Ilja had been more
faithful than himself&mdash;such variegated families are not
uncommon&mdash;I believe, though I may be doing her an
injustice, that her first impulse would be to write to the
papers in drastic denunciation of the Serbian authorities.
They have, like most of us, sufficient to regret&mdash;for
example, the person whom they sent to Pe&#263;, when they
wanted the land to be distributed, was King Peter's
Master of the Horse. He was thoroughly unsuitable,
and caused a great deal of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>There was a time at the rather gloomy town of
Djakovica, when, owing to the blood-vengeance, the
Merturi were unable for eight years to enter the place;
now they come in, merely to gaze at the Serbian major
who is in command. Halim Beg Derala, the aristocratic
and wealthy ex-mayor, who as a pastime used to plan
an occasional robbery in Turkish days, told me&mdash;he speaks
a little French, in addition to Albanian, Turkish, Serbian
and Greek&mdash;that citizens were often unable to leave their
houses for two months at a time,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and although every
house was provisioned for a siege, yet one frequently
had to manage without bread. Now the candid-eyed,
fair-bearded priest rides out with Ljuba Kujundji&#263;, the
erstwhile leader of komitadji, in order to negotiate
with the Albanian Zeph Voglia, at that personage's own
request, for his surrender to the Serb authorities. Zeph
has written from a forest that he feels uneasy, because
he owes sixteen blood-vengeances. He asks that his
affairs may be settled by the law, and those sixteen
pursuing countrymen of his have signified that this will
meet their views, since in the first place the Serbs are
disinterested in the matters between them, and, secondly,
the Serbian penalties are not so mild as theirs, not permitting
that a murder shall be expiated by the payment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>of a moderate sum or that a guilty party may absent
himself for three years and suffer no further loss than the
devastation of his house. Another sphere in which the
Serbs have gained Albanian sympathies is with regard
to the disputed ownership of land. Even as the Moors
have been in the habit of handing down, from father to
son, the key of some Sevillan house that vanished centuries
ago, the Montenegrins, more fortunate, have been appearing
with the ancient title-deeds of lands that now are
in Albanian possession. According to Serbian law it is
the oldest document which prevails. And the Albanians
are generously compensated.... Those who, with the
highest motives, advocate "Albania for the Albanians,"
may argue that the medi&aelig;val activities of Riza Beg
and Bairam Beg Zur&mdash;whose adherents started shooting
at each other every evening after six o'clock in the refuse-laden
streets of Djakovica&mdash;would have been concluded
and would not have been continued by their sons even
if the Serbs had not appeared. Let them, before proclaiming
the modern reasonableness of the Albanians,
recollect that in 1919 the Moslem Bosniak ex-prisoners
required on the average three months in order to traverse
central Albania, the country of their co-religionists.
From village to village the Bosniaks made their way,
earning a little and then being plundered at the next
place. Eighty per cent. of this population believe, in
their fanaticism, that the Sultan will again unfurl over
them his flag and that the world will ultimately be converted
to Muhammed. And if, entertaining such ideas,
they are so rigorous towards their fellow-Moslems, what
prospect is there that this 80 per cent. will assist the
Orthodox and Catholic Albanians in building up a State?
Their ferocity, in fact, is so profound that it thrives on a
diet which is chiefly of milk.... Perhaps a day will
come when the Albanian will submit to be ruled by a
member of another tribe, when local politics will engage
his attention less than the silver, iron, copper, arsenic
and water-power of his country. Perhaps the day will
come. Midway between Djakovica and the monastery
of De&#269;ani there stand two large houses side by side.
In 1909 a man belonging to one of them slew four men
of the other house, and on account of this he fled beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the Drin, together with thirteen other men of his family.
There is no knowing how long these refugees would have
stayed away if that part of the country had not come
under Serbian rule, but in 1919 negotiations were set on
foot which&mdash;to the satisfaction of the members of the
other house&mdash;would enable the thirteen innocent refugees
to return, while the criminal would be arrested.</p>

<p>As evidence of the cordiality now prevailing between
Albanian and Serb in Yugoslavia, one may mention
those cases where the Albanians in 1919 entered into a
bond that for six months they would exact no blood-vengeance
from their fellow-countrymen; the number
of these debts which hitherto had been regarded as debts
of honour was very considerable, for they were not only
incurred by assassination but could also be in payment
of a mere scowl or of your wife, from within the house,
having heard the voice of another man raised in song.
The Serbian authorities are hoping confidently that the
Albanians who have thus for a season placed themselves
under the law will be ready in the future to pledge themselves.
They are beginning to see that in a place the size
of Djakovica it should be possible to make a wheel,
that one should be able to find a shop whose contents
are worth more than 100 francs, that the breed of their
cattle, of their sheep and goats and horses could be
vastly improved, that if their land were sanely treated
it could be rendered much more fertile, and that their
system of fruit cultivation is absurdly primitive....
And with Djakovica and the whole region of Kossovo
being treated as we have shown by the Yugoslavs I think
it will be almost as great a surprise to the reader as it
was to the local population when he learns that in a
memorandum of April 26, 1921, the Tirana Government
complained to the League of Nations that the Yugoslav
civil and military officials were behaving in a very pitiless
fashion towards the Albanians. Certainly they have not
as yet established Albanian schools, but they propose
to do so when there is accommodation and when teachers
are available; and then, maybe, to the disgust of Miss
Durham, Mr. Herbert, etc., the Albanians of the district
will, with an eye to the future, prefer to visit the Yugoslav
schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">7. RELIGIOUS AND OTHER MATTERS IN THE BORDER
REGION</p>

<p>Having glanced at what the Serbs have done in such
a very short time&mdash;most of the years since 1913 being
years of war&mdash;to win the gratitude of their Albanian
fellow-subjects, we shall, in following a possible frontier
between Yugoslavia and the Albanians, at any rate
believe that many Albanians of those thus coming under
Yugoslav rule would regard the change, as well they may,
with equanimity. Suppose, then, that the frontier were
to run along the watershed at the top of the mountain
range to the west of Lake Ochrida. The people living
to the east of this line in that district would acknowledge
their Serbian origin. Thence passing to the neighbourhood
of the village of Lin and from there in a northwesterly
direction, so as to include in Yugoslavia the
Golo Brdo, the so-called Bald Mountains, whose thirty
villages are inhabited by Islamized Serbs who only speak,
with very rare exceptions, the Serbian language, one
may say that not only would their inclusion in Yugoslavia
be beneficial to these people, but that they would accept
it with alacrity. No very deep impression has been
made upon them by the religion to which, not long ago,
they were converted. In the Golo Brdo it was in great
measure due to the Greek Church which, about the
middle of the nineteenth century, left the region without
a single priest, so that children of the age of eight had
not been christened, and the people in disgust went
over to Islam. Near Ochrida, some of them were asked
whether they frequented the mosque.</p>

<p>"Never," they replied.</p>

<p>"What is your religion?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is very strange," they told us, "but we have
none."</p>

<p>"What religion did you formerly have?"</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know."</p>

<p>Their priest roams the mountains with his gun, and
there has been a tendency, since a man in this position
received his salary from the State, for many to persuade
the mufti to appoint them, irrespective of whether they
could read or write. The devout Moslem is, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
exclusion of everything else, a Moslem; but in these
districts, where the faith was assumed in a moment
of pique or as a protection, and where the Muhammedan
clergy has been so negligent, the people are gladly cultivating
their Christian relatives. In the district of Suva
Rieka one hears of conversions to Christianity, and the
functionaries bring no pressure to bear, unlike the misguided
Montenegrin officials who in 1912 rode into Pe&#263;,
the old Patriarchate, and wanted in their delight to have
everyone immediately to adopt the Orthodox faith.
Now the authorities, with greater wisdom, do not interfere
in these matters. They know that Yugoslavia will have
no enemy in that house in the village of Brod, between
Tetovo and Prizren, where two brothers are living
together, of whom one went over to Islam. They know
that the Muhammedan Krasnichi of Albania are proclaiming
their kinship with the great Montenegrin clan
of Vasojevi&#263;, that the Gashi are calling to the Piperi
and the Berishi to the Ku&#269;i. The new cordiality will be
impaired neither by the differences of religion nor by
the similarity of costume. The average Albanian of
Djakovica would not be any fonder of an Orthodox
fellow-citizen if the latter continues to wear the Albanian
dress which was generally adopted about a hundred
years ago, and the Vasojevi&#263; may please themselves as
to the wearing of a costume which they once found so
useful in the Middle Ages. They happened to be for ten
days in the Hoti country for the purpose of wiping out
a blood affair, and when they were about to fall into the
Hoti's hands they shouted, "What do you want with
us? We are Kastrati!" The Kastrati, to whom these
Albanian-clad people were led, confirmed the statement,
so that the Vasojevi&#263; earned for themselves the nickname
of Kastratovi&#263;.</p>

<p>From the Golo Brdo the best frontier would pass
north-eastwards to the Black Drin and along that river
until it is joined by the White Drin. This is a poor
country whose inhabitants are, for the most part, Moslemized
Serbs. About a hundred men are now engaged
in excavating the very finely decorated Serbian church
at Pi&#353;kopalja on the Drin&mdash;much to the edification of
the local Moslems. This church of their ancestors was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
covered in during the Middle Ages in order to conceal it
from the Turks. Too often the natives' present occupation
is brigandage; but from of old they have had
economic relations with Prizren, to which old town of
vine-arched, narrow, winding streets and picturesque
bazaars these countryfolk have been accustomed to come
every week. These Moslems (of whom there are some
100,000 in the department of Prizren, with 13,000
Orthodox and 3000 Catholics) used to detest the
Christians on account of their religion, although half of
the Moslems could speak nothing but Serbian. The
Serbs, it must be admitted, were not always blameless;
in the early nineties, for example, they suspended a pig's
head outside the mosque. And the amenities of Prizren
were complicated by the hostility between Orthodox and
Catholic. This was largely due to the fact that, by the
intervention of the French Consul after the Crimean War,
the Catholics&mdash;descendants of Ragusan emigrants of the
Middle Ages&mdash;had secured the former Orthodox church
of St. Demetrius, in which church, by the way, the services
had come to be held in Albanian. When the Vatican, in
the second half of the nineteenth century, sent a Serbian
priest, the congregation had become so thoroughly
Albanized that after a year he had to leave. The propaganda
of Austria, Italy and Russia did nothing towards
persuading the three religions of Prizren to regard each
other in a more amicable fashion; while Italy and Austria
gave exclusive assistance to the Catholics, whom they
found in such distress that, forty years ago, most of them
went barefoot, the presence of the Russian Consul was
of such importance to the Orthodox that their position
at Prizren was better than in their old patriarchal town
of Pe&#263;. Nowadays, with Austrian and Russian propaganda
deleted, there is only that of the Italians, whose
proposal to create an independent Albania (under Italian
protection) was at first applauded by some simple folk in
1919. The Moslem took to accepting Italian money
and then honourably informing the Yugoslav authorities
that they had been appointed as agents of Italy; they
offered to capture the Franciscan priests with whose
help the Italians were trying to secure the Catholics; and
as for the cash, it seems mostly to have been spent in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
convivial fashion by the Moslems and the Serbs together.
This friendship appears likely to continue, for the Serbian
authorities, so far from countenancing such pranks as
that of the pig's head, do not even propose to reconsecrate
their ancient church of Petka. When this building
was made into a mosque, the Moslem still permitted
the Christian women to come and pray there, while if a
Christian man was sick they let him leave a jar of water
in the mosque all night, so that it might acquire certain
medicinal properties. It is the intention of the Serbs not
to restore the church to Christian worship, but to turn it
into a museum.</p>

<p>With the frontier then being drawn along the Drin,
towards the Adriatic, the famous villages of Plav and
Gusinje would definitely pass to Yugoslavia, in accordance
with the wishes of a deputation sent by them to
Belgrade in 1919. The well-meaning British champions
of Gusinje, who maintain that this village is furiously
antagonistic to the Slav and is ready to struggle to the
uttermost rather than be incorporated in a Slav kingdom,
these champions do not, I think, draw a sufficient
distinction between Montenegro and Yugoslavia. Plav,
with its mostly Christian population, and Gusinje, where
the Moslem preponderates, refused at the time of the
Berlin Congress to be given to Montenegro, with which
they had certain local quarrels. Nicholas reported to
the Powers which had awarded him these places that they
were obdurate, for which reason he was given in their
stead a much-desired strip of coast, down to Dulcigno,
and nothing could have suited that astute monarch
better. Nikita&mdash;to call him by his familiar name&mdash;imagined
that the two villages would eventually fall to
Montenegro, because of the formidable mountains which
divide them from the rest of Albania; the road from
Gusinje to Scutari is very long and very arduous. When
Montenegro succeeded in capturing Plav in 1912, a certain
Muhammedan priest of that place joined the Orthodox
Church and was appointed a major in the Montenegrin
army. He acted as the president of a court-martial,
and in that capacity is reputed to have hanged or shot,
some say, as many as five hundred of his former
parishioners, because they declined to be baptized. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
told them that their ancestors were all Serbs, and that
therefore they should follow his example. Since the
Montenegrins did not restrain this over-zealous man, the
villagers were naturally not in favour of that country.
Montenegro had a very small number of good officials,
owing to Nikita's peculiar management which, in considering
his favourites, did not regard illiteracy as a bar
to the highest administrative or judicial post.... The
people of Plav and Gusinje have, on the other hand, no
hostility against Serbia. In November 1918 a detachment
of thirty Serbs was stationed at Gusinje, what time
certain Italian agents put it into the shallow minds of
some Albanians that Albania desired to be independent
under Italian protection. Nothing happened when a
Serbian force came from Mitrovica, except that these
agents and a few of their tools&mdash;be it noted that perhaps
half the population is ignorant of the Albanian language&mdash;withdrew
to the Rugovo district, where they tried to
induce the people to fly with them, so that the world
would hear how iniquitously the Serbs had acted. Those
of Rugovo refused to accompany them; in consequence
of which there was a fight, some houses were burned,
some women and cattle were seized. And afterwards
the men of Rugovo repaired to Gusinje and exacted a
vengeance which, the most Serbophobe person will admit,
had nothing to do with the Serbs. The luckless village
of Gusinje was again laid waste in 1919 by the Montenegrins,
but this came to pass as the result of the Montenegrin
clan of Vasojevi&#263; having their property ravaged by
some Albanian marauders who were prompted by the
same Great Power. The Vasojevi&#263; believed that this
evil deed was done by the men of Gusinje, so that they
destroyed their houses. When the facts were explained
to them, the Vasojevi&#263; said that they were prepared to
rebuild the village. And now Plav and Gusinje, who ask
for Serbian and not Montenegrin officials, recognize that
it is impossible for them to live except in union with
Yugoslavia.... Miss Durham's wrath concerning an
affair which happened during 1919 in this region shows to
what lengths a partisan will go. She complained with
great bitterness that the Serbs had actually arrested a
British officer whose purpose it was to make investigations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>The Serbs are human beings and are not immune
from error; and Miss Durham is so determined to expose
them that if all her charges were dealt with from Belgrade
it would necessitate the appointment of one or two
more officials. But in this particular case she is not the
sole accuser. A Captain Willett Cunnington&mdash;who,
according to the President of the Anglo-Albanian Society,
the Hon. Aubrey Herbert, M.P., has several years'
intimate experience of Albania&mdash;said in the <i>New Statesman</i>
that in consequence of what occurred to Captain
Brodie the Serbian Government was compelled to
apologize abjectly. Now I happen to be very well
acquainted with the stalwart Pouni&#353;a Ra&#269;i&#263;, the Montenegrin
who arrested Brodie. Albanians have told me
that Pouni&#353;a's knowledge of the north and north-west
of their country is not a matter of villages but of houses.
And he has always observed the customs which prevail
in those houses, so that when he is known to be approaching,
the people who live at a distance of many hours
will come to meet him, whether for the pure delight of
discharging their firearms to his greater glory or for the
purpose of seeking his advice. It is not because he has
studied jurisprudence in Paris that they respect him in
that bitter region, but because he does not disregard the
laws that govern the wild hearts on both sides of the
frontier. Yet I suppose Captain Brodie had never heard
of him&mdash;poor Captain Brodie! unconscious of the great
good luck which had brought him into the presence of
this man who could have made his journey much more
pleasant for himself and vastly more profitable for his
superiors.</p>

<p>This is what Pouni&#353;a Ra&#269;i&#263; told me:</p>

<p>"At the end of January and the beginning of
February 1919, we were having a certain amount of
trouble in the Gusinje and Plav district, where I
was acting as delegate of the Belgrade Government.
Travellers were being murdered, telephone wires were
being cut, and so forth. In those parts, which I have
known for so many years, it is a good deal easier to
ascertain a criminal's name than to seize him, and I had
not captured these malefactors when one day I had
a message to say that a European Commission was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
approaching. Later on I was told that thirty-nine of its
members were Albanians. I ordered my lieutenant to
find out whether they were from our territory, in which
case they were to be disarmed and brought to me; or
from Albania, in which event they were to be received
politely. A quarter of an hour after this I was told that
they were all well-known brigands from our State, and
there was one specially notorious person, Djer Doucha,
who in 1912 was converted to Christianity and was made
a gendarme at the court of King Nicholas; in 1915, after
the Austrian invasion, he was reconverted to Islam and
became a sergeant of <i>gendarmerie</i>. In that position he
killed fifty or sixty Serbs and Montenegrins, to say
nothing of his other acts of violence. In 1918, for instance,
he murdered seven school-children whom he met on the
road.</p>

<p>"I had some urgent business at Plav," continued
Ra&#269;i&#263;, "and there all these people were brought before
me. In addition to the thirty-nine Albanians there were
three men in British uniforms. I was acquainted with
one of them, a certain Perola, a Catholic of Pe&#263;, a former
Austrian agent who had committed many crimes against
the Serbs and had lately escaped from the prison at Pe&#263;.
One of the other two said that he was Captain Brodie,
whom the London Government had sent as their delegate
for Albania and Montenegro. I suppose the third man
was his British orderly; I never heard him speak. But
Brodie said many things. One of them (which was
quite true) was that his Government had not yet recognized
the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
He demanded the instant release of his companions.
'Do you know who they are?' said I. 'That is no
concern of yours,' said he. 'Well,' said I, 'they are
criminals, and it is for the judges to say whether or not
they are to be liberated.' 'I protest,' he exclaimed, 'in
the name of England, against their arrest!' 'And I
thank you,' said I, 'in the name of the Serbian police,
for having brought them here.' 'You are a savage,
a barbarous nation!' said he, 'and you don't deserve
to be free and independent.' 'Sir,' said I, 'if you are an
Englishman you should know that we are your allies,
that you and we have shed our blood for the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
cause. We love England very much, and I am very
surprised to hear a British officer speak in this way.'
Again he demanded to be set free, he and all his people,
so that he could continue his mission; but I told him
that after what I had heard from him and what I had
seen of his escort, I could not permit him to go on to
other villages unless he could show me an authorization
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Belgrade. 'I
do not recognize the Belgrade Government,' said he.
'Whom, then,' I asked, 'do you regard as the legitimate
ruler of this country?' 'King Nicholas,' said he, 'and
the Government of Montenegro.' So I advised him to
get a visa from King Nicholas and to come back to perform
his mission, when that visa would be honoured. 'Anyhow,'
said he, 'the people of these parts are against
Serbia.' Thereupon I sent for the chief men and told
them to say quite candidly in front of this Englishman
what they wanted. There were five Moslems, including
Islam and Abdi Beg Rejepagi&#263; (the leading family) and
Ismael Omeragi&#263;, also two Christians, of whom I remember
Stani&#269;a Turkovi&#263;. 'Long live Serbia!' they
shouted. 'Death to Nicholas and the Albanians!' On
hearing this Captain Brodie was discontented; he told
me that I was a savage and did not know how to esteem an
Englishman. 'I esteem you very much,' said I, 'and
because he is wearing a British uniform I won't arrest
this interpreter of yours.' (By the way, Perola was not
acting as interpreter in our conversation, as the captain
and I were talking French.) 'He used to be an Austrian
agent,' said I. 'You are a liar!' cried Brodie; 'I
know this man; he was nothing of the sort.' I remained
calm, but I told him that he must not speak to me again
in such a way. I asked him how long he had known
Perola, who had got away from our prison a month ago.
'I have known him for a month,' said Brodie. 'And
now,' said I, 'will you please show me your documents?'
'I have none,' said he, 'and I do not require any, as I am
a British officer.' 'But I have read in the papers,' said
I, 'that your people arrested and shot several persons
who were wearing the uniform of a British officer. If
you have no documents to prove that you are not a spy
and that you are a British officer I shall have to arrest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
you.' Then he showed me one with some Italian words
on it, I think a permission to go somewhere on the Piave
front. 'From now,' said I, 'you are arrested; no one
can come to you and you cannot leave this house. Prepare
yourself to start to-morrow or the day after, if you
are tired, for Pe&#263;, and perhaps Skoplje, so that you may
prove your identity.' He protested, and declared that
he must see the people in the neighbouring villages. 'If
you are a real Englishman,' said I, 'I could not allow
you to go by yourself, since there are many Moslems in
these parts who have been excited against England by
their hodjas, owing to your war with Turkey. They
might kill you, and I would be held responsible; so that
even if you had the necessary documents I could only let
you go if precautions were taken to guard you. I am
sorry,' said I, 'that you should have spoken as you
have done against the Serbs; in fact, it seems to me that
you are doing a disservice to England, and that here in
this village I am serving her more truly.' 'I decline
to go to Pe&#263;,' said Brodie; 'I want to go to Scutari.'
'You must go to Pe&#263;,' said I. He said that I could
telephone concerning him either to the Belgrade Government
or to the General at Cetinje. 'Unfortunately,' said
I, 'it is these people who are with you who cut the telephone
wires two days ago.' After this I appointed a
guard for him. I gave him my room, with soldiers to
serve him, to keep the room warm and bring him whatever
food we had. [Observe that the above-mentioned
Captain Willett Cunnington wrote in the <i>New Statesman</i>
that Brodie was treated with "gross indignity."] 'Three
horses were got ready,' said Ra&#269;i&#263; in conclusion, 'and on
these they rode to Pe&#263;, accompanied by a guard, both to
prevent them from escaping and from coming to harm.'"<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In its old Albanian days the village of Gusinje was
perhaps the most inaccessible spot in Europe&mdash;it was
rarely possible for anyone to obtain permission to approach
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>it. Even to Miss Durham, friend of the Albanians, this
people sent a decided refusal. But now, under the
guidance of the Yugoslav authorities, they have abandoned
these boorish ways; Miss Durham could go there
at any time, but maybe the village no longer attracts
her.</p>


<p class="section">8. A DIGRESSION ON TWO RIVAL ALBANIAN AUTHORITIES</p>

<p>[We have more than once alluded to the writings of
Miss Durham, since very few British authors have dealt
with Albania, and she has come to be regarded as a trustworthy
expert. But the flagrant partiality of her latest
book (<i>Twenty Years of Balkan Tangle</i>; London, 1920),
which, moreover, is written with great bitterness, will
make the public turn, I hope, to Sir Charles Eliot, who
is a vastly better cicerone. The present ambassador in
Japan is, of course, one of the foremost men of this generation.
His Balkan studies are as supremely competent
as his monumental work on British Nudibranchiate
Mollusca, published by the Ray Society when Sir Charles,
having resigned the Governorship of East Africa, was
Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield University. Equally admired
are his researches into Chinese linguistics and his monograph,
the first in the language, on that most obscure
subject, Finnish grammar.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Will it be believed that in
her account of the Balkan tangle Miss Durham does not
quote Sir Charles Eliot, but Mr. Horatio Bottomley?
It seems that Mr. Bottomley has not devoted much attention
to the Balkans, since in November 1920 he poured
the vials of his wrath upon the Serbs, who, according to
his "latest reports from Montenegro," had destroyed no
less than 4000 Montenegrin houses in the district of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>Dibra, a place which lies some 75 miles by road from
the land of the Black Mountain and probably does not
possess more than two or three Montenegrin houses;
but he flings hard words against the Serbs, and that is
good enough for Miss Durham. On the other hand, Sir
Charles Eliot, who has travelled largely in Albania, wrote
the simple facts about that people and they are obnoxious
to this lady. "It is not surprising to find that there is
no history of Albania, for there is no union between
North and South, or between the different northern
tribes and the different southern Beys," said he in 1900,
and such a people does not undergo a fundamental change
in twenty years. "Only two names," says Eliot, "those
of Skanderbeg and Ali Pasha of Janina, emerge from
the confusion of justly unrecorded tribal quarrels....
Albania presents nothing but oppositions&mdash;North against
South, tribe against tribe, Bey against Bey." (According
to Miss Durham they are all aflame with the desire
to form a nation.) "Even family ties seem to be somewhat
weak," says Sir Charles, "for since European
influence has diminished the African slave-trade, Albanians
have taken to selling their female children to supply
the want of negroes." (The Albanians are "enterprising
and industrious," says Miss Durham.) "In many
ways," says Eliot, "they are in Europe what the Kurds
are in Asia. Both are wild and lawless tribes who inflict
much damage on decent Turks and Christians alike.
Both might be easily brought to reason by the exhibition
of a little firmness.... Albanian patriotism is not a
home product&mdash;had they ever been ready to combine
against the Turk there seems to be no reason why they
should not have preserved the same kind of independence
as Montenegro; but from the first some of the tribes
and clans endeavoured to secure an advantage over the
others by siding with the invaders&mdash;papers and books
on the national movement are written at Bucharest,
Brussels and various Italian towns, but they are not read
at Scutari or Janina. The stock grievance of this literature
is that the Turks will not allow Albanian to be
taught in the schools, and endeavour to ignore the existence
of the language; but though the complaint is well-founded,
I doubt if the mass of the people have much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
feeling on the subject." ... Those who are rash enough
to assert, because Miss Durham says so, that in the last
two decades the Albanians have made a progress of
several centuries may be recommended to the testimony
of Brailsford<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> (1906), of Katarani (1913), and of the
Italian Press which, after the retreat of their army to
Valona, published in 1920 the most ghastly particulars
of what befell the hapless officers and men who were
captured by the Albanians.</p>

<p>Let the British public henceforth go to Sir Charles
Eliot and not to this emotional lady for its picture of the
unchanged Shqyptar. She reveals to us that more than
one person in the Balkans said that her knowledge of
those countries is enormous; she has knocked about
the western Balkans and picked up a good deal of material,
but her knowledge has its limitations: for example, she
makes the old howler of ascribing Macedonian origin to
Pa&#353;i&#263;, though his grandfather came not from Tetovo in
Macedonia but from near Teteven in what is now Bulgaria.
Miss Durham plumes herself for having sent back to
Belgrade the Order of St. Sava, and seeing that it is
bestowed for learning she did well. But even if her
acquaintance with Balkan affairs were more adequate&mdash;her
diagnosis of the Macedonian racial problem is extremely
rough and ready&mdash;all the writings of Miss Durham
are so warped with hatred for the Slav that they must
be very carefully approached. Because she thinks it
will incline her readers towards the Albanians she says<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
that they were early converts to Christianity. She
omits to mention that the Moslem, on arriving in the
Balkans, was able to spread his religion much more
easily in Albania than anywhere else; and again, in the
seventeenth century, when Constantinople offered many
lucrative posts to the Moslem there occurred in Albania
a great wave of apostasy. Miss Durham speaks with
pride of the Albanians who during the Great War fought
in the French, Italian and American ranks. Would it
not be more straightforward if she added that large
numbers were enrolled in the Austro-Hungarian army
and <i>gendarmerie</i>? The special task of the latter was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>to dislodge from their mountain fastnesses those Montenegrins
who continued to carry on a desperate guerilla
warfare against the invader. To pretend that the Albanian
has earned the freedom of his country by his glorious
exploits in the War is an absurdity. He is a medi&aelig;val
fellow, much more anxious to have a head to bash than
to ascertain whom it belongs to. The Slavs have not
always treated their raw neighbours with indulgence;
in the Balkan War, when their army marched through
Albania to the sea some very discreditable incidents
occurred, whatever may have been the provocation they
received from the sniping natives and however great be
the excuse of their own state of nerves. Yet the first
stone should be flung by that army of Western Europe
which, in its passage through the territory of a treacherous
and savage people, has done nothing which it would not
willingly forget. And seriously to argue that the Slavs
are of an almost undiluted blackness, while the Albanians
are endearing creatures, is to take what anti-feminists
would call a feminist view of history. Miss Durham tells
us that some years ago she stood upon a height with an
Albanian abbot and promised him that she would do all
that lay in her power to bring a knowledge of Albania
to the English. The worthy abbot may have glanced at
her uneasily, but noticing her rapt expression reassured
himself. And she appears to have believed that England,
eagerly absorbing what she told them of this people,
would in August 1914 make her policy depend on their
convenience. But to Miss Durham's horror and amazement,
Great Britain turned aside from this clear and
honourable duty. She entered the War as an ally of
the Slav, bringing "shame and disgust" upon Miss
Durham. "After that," says she, "I really did not
care what happened. The cup of my humiliation was
full."]</p>


<p class="section">9. WHAT FACES THE YUGOSLAVS</p>

<p>It is not as if Serbia never made mistakes in dealing
with the Albanians. The Sultan used to govern them by
sending in one year an army against them, and in the
next year asking for no recruits or taxes. The Montenegrins,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of whom the older generation was bored when it
had no man to shoot at, used to be on very neighbourly
terms with them. Both these systems the Albanians
could understand. But they did not know why the
Belgrade Government in 1878&mdash;and it was a mistaken
policy&mdash;should expel a number of Albanians from the
newly-won zones, thrusting them across the frontier and
putting in their place a number of Serbs who were settled
in Old Serbia. The twofold folly of this plan was not
grasped at the moment; but for several years the Serbian
frontier districts were regularly invaded and plundered.
The following years of Turkish misrule, and especially
the young Turkish policy of treacherous force, which
resulted in Albanian risings every year, may possibly have
caused many Albanians to be honestly glad when the
Balkan War brought the Serbs into their country. But of
these Albanians not a few would rejoice because they
hoped that with the help of the Serbian army it would be
possible to slay the members of some adjacent tribe
against whom they happened to have a feud. Perhaps
the Serbs were so eager to bathe their horses in the
Adriatic that they did not notice such trifles as the
destruction of a ford, this having been done to prevent
a visit from undesirable neighbours. One might have
imagined that Serbia, being well known as a land of small
peasant proprietors&mdash;where there is even a law which
forbids a peasant's house from being sold over his head;
he is, under any circumstances, assured of so much as will
enable him to eke out a livelihood&mdash;one would have
thought that the Albanian <i>&#269;if&#269;ija</i>, who is nothing more
than a slave of the feudal chief, would have rejoiced at the
arrival of a liberator; and indeed, while the Serbian troops
were in Albania the peasant refused to give his lord the
customary third or half of what the land produced, and
after the departure of the Serbs he was unapproachable
for tax-collectors. Who knows whether this social readjustment,
so auspiciously begun, might not have made
Albania wipe out her grievances against the Serbs and
remember only that in the Imperial days of Du&#353;an, even
if he was not of the most ancient Balkan race, there was
prosperity and happiness where now is desolation; busy
merchants in the seaport towns of Albania, which now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
are ruins; ships sailing in from Venice with the luxuries
of all the world and taking back with them all those good
things, a half of which Albania has forgotten how to
make? And after that there had been times of friendship
with the Serb&mdash;Dositej Obradovi&#263;, the philologist (one of
those amiable persons who invented for the Albanians
an alphabet), tells us, for instance, how in his travels
through Albania he was assured by natives that they and
the Serbs lived together as if they were members of one
family, while the Ku&#263;i in eastern Montenegro had, by a
gradual process of assimilation, become transformed from
Catholic Albanians into Orthodox Montenegrins. It is
told that in the wondrous hours when the <i>&#269;if&#269;ija</i> gloried
in the soil he was about to win, even the notoriously
wild Klementi, filled with hunger for the land, ran down
from their fastnesses. But, most unfortunately, at that
moment the Great Powers decided that Albania was to
be an autonomous, hereditary State. This interrupted
the movement towards reconciliation with Serbia; and
even now the Serbs will be told by many encouraging
people that in their efforts to win the regard of Albanians
they have an impossible task, that if some of them take
a step towards you one day they will rush back a dozen
on the day after. These people will repeat the legend that
the Albanians have an invincible hatred for the Slavs;
but the Albanians have not forgotten how, in the course
of the Middle Ages, they were willingly open to Slav
penetration&mdash;the Serbian language reached to beyond
Alessio, the small Albanian dynasties intermarried with
Slav ruling families, so that they preferred to speak
Serbian, and down to this day two-thirds of the place-names
of northern Albania are of Slav origin. One of
the most important documents in this connection is a
letter from the town of Dubrovnik to the Emperor Sigismund
in the year 1434. They inform the Emperor that
Andria Topia, lord of the Albanian coast, has secretaries
who know nothing but the Serbian language and alphabet.
Thus when the Emperor sends him letters in Latin he is
obliged to have them translated elsewhere, and the contents
of the Imperial letters are not kept secret. So the
Emperor was forced to write to Topia in Serbian....
Long memories are not always inconvenient, and Albanian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
memories are long because, until recent years, all that
they knew came from tradition&mdash;Austria and Italy had
not yet become so concerned about Albanian education
that (forgetting their own illiterates in Bosnia and
Calabria) the two Allies waved into existence boys' and
girls' schools up and down the country; so desirous
were they that these founts of knowledge should be
patronized that both Italians and Austrians were prepared
to pay good money and eke a supply of garments and a
gaily-coloured picture of King or Emperor, as the case
might be; and with respect to the cash, not only was
each willing to pay but to pay more than the other. Yet
the Albanian is most mindful of tradition, and he is aware
that his approach to the Slav in the Middle Ages was
blocked by the inopportune arrival of the Turks; it is in
the nature of man that the Albanian was more impressed
by the brilliant young States of the early princes, with
that barbarically sumptuous residence at Scutari (the
Catholics of Scutari also being in the diocese of Antivari,
which was under Serb domination) than, centuries later,
when he found himself confronted with the pitiable
population of Old Serbia.</p>

<p>In the Sandjak the task of Yugoslavia will be relatively
simple; the Albanians who live there are not
autochthonous, but arrived at the beginning of the
eighteenth century on the plateau of Pechter. These
Klementi&mdash;then very numerous&mdash;cared nothing for their
Serbian origin, so that the Patriarch of Pe&#263; had to protect
himself against them by means of a janissary guard&mdash;which
the Sultan permitted him to maintain at his own
expense&mdash;whereas they were attentive to the teachings of
their religion, in so far as they obeyed the Catholic
missionaries who dwelt among them and requested that
in their forays they should confine themselves to
Muhammedan and Orthodox booty. One of the places
they attacked was Plav, from which they drove the
population, and themselves henceforward took to living
on the fertile fields in summer, while they spent the winter
in some mountain caverns. But after seven years a large
proportion of this tribe went back to its ancestral stronghold
in the Brdo range, from which the Turks had transplanted
them to the Sandjak. This wish of theirs to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
to their old home was gratified after they had beaten off
the Turks triumphantly in various engagements on the
way, and even pursued them to their trenches.... The
Klementi who had stayed on the Pechter were further
depleted a few years later, when their kinsfolk, answering
the appeal of the Archbishop of Antivari, <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'irode'">rode</ins> up there
and carried off fifty families who were on the eve of
renouncing their religion. The final group which remained
became Moslem, and with such ardour that when
the Serbs of Kara George reached the Sandjak they found
that these Klementi were completely Islamized; they
resisted the Serbian army with the utmost resolution.
Subsequently they attempted to convert the Serbian
population round them, but with mediocre success, for
the Klementi themselves were not too strong; moreover,
they were isolated from the other Muhammedan Albanians.</p>

<p>And yet certain incidents which occurred in the
Sandjak during the Great War seem to show that even
there the task of dealing with the population is a troublous
one. They are conservative; one sees, for example, a
woman who has got up very early holding aloft a vessel
against the sun. This is done with the object of preventing
the cows of a certain man from giving any milk.
But the man is on the alert. He shoots the vessel out
of her hand and proceeds, with an easy mind, about
his business. Frequently the Austrians disarmed these
men, but it is their practice to have more rifles than
shirts, although during the occupation a rifle cost twenty
napoleons. It occurred to the Austrian Governor-General
of Montenegro, Lieut. Field-Marshal von Weber,
that these Albanians were children and, if treated well,
would make useful volunteers. A party of them was
thereupon sent to Graz, where they were told that they
would be trained to fight on behalf of the Sultan. Their
military education was a trifle agitated&mdash;for instance,
on their second day at Graz they thrashed their officers&mdash;but
when their training was considered adequate they
were sent to the front, and there they immediately
surrendered to the Italians. This was not the first time
that a body of Albanians had gone to Austria. In 1912,
for the Eucharistic Congress at Vienna, some two dozen
of them, in their national costume and conducted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
their priests, had taken part in the procession. It is
said that the financier Rosenberg, of whom one has
heard, bore a portion of the pretty large expenses of the
deputation. His title of baron dates from this period.
Austria's work among the school-children was no more
successful than among the adults. Remembering that
just outside Zadar lies Arbanasi, or Borgo Erizzo, a
village of 2500 inhabitants, nearly all of whom are
Albanians, it seemed good to the Austrian authorities
to procure from that place a schoolmaster who would
make suitable propaganda. There was at Arbanasi a
teachers' institute, as also an Italian "Liga" school
which was closed by the Austrians during the War, and
when the schoolmaster arrived at Plav, where the people
speak Serbian, he set about teaching the children Albanian
and also making propaganda for Italy, as he was from the
"Liga" school.... That fidelity of the five hundred
men of Plav who clung, as we have related, to their
religion, had its pendant when the Austrians were engaged
in constructing a road. The custom was for a potentate
of that district to procure for the Austrians a sufficient
number of men, to whom three or four crowns a day
would be paid. Any man who disregarded the potentate's
summons was thrashed by him, and thrashed in such a
way that for three days he was prostrate. The late
Chief of Police at Sarajevo, Mr. Ljescovac, was (being a
Bosnian subject) administering this district during the
Austrian occupation. He tried frequently to get particulars
from the men who had been so mercilessly flogged,
with a view to opening an inquiry. Their invariable
answer was: "I know nothing."</p>

<p>In the days of Charles, another member of the Topia
family, a copyist, who was in his service, was transcribing
the Chronicle of George Hamartolos, and twice, thinking
of his master, he inserts: "God, help Charles Topia."
As we leave the Serb and the Albanian face to face,
sensitive, imaginative, tenacious people, both with very
ancient claims, we must hope that a happy solution
will be found. After all Serbia, being in Yugoslavia, is
now a Muhammedan and a Catholic Power. She has
men at her disposal, such as Major Musakadi&#263;, a Bosnian
Moslem who deserted from the Austrian army to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Serbs, fought with them on several fronts and received
the highest decoration for valour, the Kara George; then,
after the War, he was sent by the Government to command
at Br&#263;ko, a place in his native Bosnia where there is a
Moslem majority. A few of the Orthodox protested
energetically that they would not have a Moslem over
them; they were received by the Minister of Justice
in Belgrade. "Gentlemen," said he, "go back to Br&#263;ko
and when anyone of you has earned the Cross of Kara
George I shall be glad to see him here again." ... As
in the old days, the Serbian civilization is far superior,
but this is not everything; that the Albanian is ready
to meet it with peace or war he shows clearly as he glides
along in his white skull-cap, his close-fitting white and
black costume, with his panther-like tread and with
several weapons and an umbrella.</p>

<p>But for the various reasons to which we have alluded
he is now much more inclined to live in peace with the
Yugoslav. Very differently, except if they are charged
with gifts, does he receive the Italians; even at the
moment of accepting their gifts of military material and
cash he regards them with a more or less concealed
derision, for he is impressed, as we have pointed out, by
nothing so much as by military prowess and the reverse,
whereof the news is carried far and wide. At the end
of September and beginning of October 1918 two weak
Yugoslav battalions of about a thousand rifles accomplished
at Tirana what the large Italian forces could
not, at any rate did not, achieve. Ten thousand Austrians
were in the town, and for three months the Italians had
sat down outside it. Then the Serbs descended on the
place from the mountains; their carts came by the
ordinary road, and on arriving at the Italian lines the
drivers asked for hay; but when they explained that
the rest of their force was going round by the mountain
trail the Italian commandant refused to give any supplies
to such liars. (Later on, though, he gave them sufficient
for five days.) When an Austrian officer who was
stationed in a minaret saw the Serbs coming down from
those terrible heights he was so astonished that he felt
sure they must be robbers. And after they had captured
the town and the Italians conducted themselves as if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
were they who had conquered it, the Serbs took to
thrashing their allies and ejecting them from the caf&eacute;s.
The Italians did not protest....</p>


<p class="section">10. DR. TRUMBI&#262;'S PROPOSAL</p>

<p>To sum up this part of our long and, I fear, rather
tiring dissertation on the Yugoslav-Albanian frontier that
is to be: the Yugoslav delegates at the Peace Conference
invariably disclaimed any desire to have Albanian lands
conferred on them against the wish of the inhabitants.
According to Prince Sixte of Parma, the ex-Emperor
Karl was disposed to offer to the Serbs as a basis of peace
a Southern Slav kingdom consisting of Serbia, Montenegro,
Bosnia, Herzegovina and the whole of Albania. But
this last item only made it clear that in his brief tenure
of the throne the Emperor had grasped something of the
grand generosity of European statesmen when they deal
with the possessions of other people in the Near East.
The Albanians are not Southern Slavs, and it is merely
the voice of the thoughtless mob in Montenegro which has
been claiming Scutari for the reason that they held it in
the Middle Ages&mdash;several of their rulers are buried there&mdash;and
because 20,000 Montenegrins gave their lives to take
it in the Balkan War. Responsible persons in Yugoslavia,
such as Dr. Trumbi&#263;, the former Foreign Minister, do not
believe that Scutari is a necessity for their State&mdash;whether
Yugoslavia is a necessity for Scutari is another question&mdash;and
they hold that it is quite possible to preserve the 1913
frontier (perhaps with a minor rectification in Klementi)
and live in friendship with their neighbours. This, of
course, is under the assumption that these neighbours
will "play the game"&mdash;and it is just this which the
Albanians will be unable to do if they are left to their own
slender resources. How could one expect so poor&mdash;or
shall we say so unexploited?&mdash;a country to make any
social progress without the help of others? It has become
the habit of many Albanians to accept financial assistance
from Italy; if an independent Albania is now established
these subsidies will be increased&mdash;and he who pays the
piper calls the tune. If, however, an arrangement could
be made for helping the Albanians&mdash;and the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
undertaking this would have to be devoid of Balkan
ambitions on its own account&mdash;then the 1913 frontier
would be possible. No doubt the cynics will say that
the Yugoslavs are aware that this is an unlikely solution,
and that failing a disinterested Power, whose supervision
would cause the Albanians during the troublesome civilizing
process to be moderately peaceable neighbours,
failing such a Power the Yugoslavs would feel that they
were justified in asking for the frontier of the Drin. But
this frontier I have heard advocated less by Yugoslavs of
any standing than by those Albanians who despair of
the administrative capacities of their fellow-countrymen.
The Yugoslavs have not the smallest wish to add to their
commitments, and even if all the Albanians on the right
bank of the Drin were anxious for Yugoslav overlordship&mdash;and
this, naturally, is not the case&mdash;there would be serious
hostility to be expected from some of those on the other
bank. If no disinterested Power, such as Great Britain
or Sweden, will take the matter in hand, then Dr. Trumbi&#263;
has an alternative proposal, which is for a free, independent
Albania (with the 1913 frontier) which would exist on the
Customs and on a loan made by the Great Powers, who
would put in a Controller charged with seeing that the
money were spent on roads, schools, etc. A police force,
and not an army, would be maintained; while, if need
be, the country could be neutralized; and Dr. Trumbi&#263;,
within whose lifetime bandits and heiduks were roaming
through Bosnia, believes that the Albanians would
gradually discard their cherished system of feuds....
This would be the happiest solution, for it would leave
the Balkans to the Balkan peoples, while it would aim at
the development of whatever good qualities there are in the
Albanians, and it would definitely recognize a Yugoslav-Albanian
frontier which is acceptable to both countries.</p>


<p class="section">11. THE POSITION IN 1921: THE TIRANA GOVERNMENT
AND THE MIRDITI</p>

<p>While Europe in the year 1921 was either exhausted
or belligerent, or both, she had a vague knowledge that
hostilities were being carried on between the Serbs and the
Albanians. Telegrams from Rome, Tirana and elsewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
appeared in the papers, saying that the Serbs continued to
advance. Occasionally a Serbian statesman would declare
that his Government desired the independence of Albania.
Then some Albanian delegate in Geneva would make a
protest and ask the League of Nations, of which Albania
was now a member, to take this matter in hand. A
Serbian delegate would also address the League. Again
you would hear of the Serbian army pushing forward,
that a good many soldiers had fallen. And no one seemed
to know why the Serbs would want to shed their blood
in order to add to their miscellaneous problems this very
grave one of administering such a region inhabited by
such a people. Why did they not content themselves
with the frontier which the Powers temporarily assigned
to them in 1918 and which, from the junction of the
Black and White Drin, runs south along the rocky right
bank of the river and then, crossing to the other side,
passes along the top of a range of mountains? What
more could they wish to have, presuming that it was not
their intention to annex what lay between them and the
Adriatic?</p>

<p>Well, it appears that never once did they go beyond
the aforementioned line to which they were legally entitled,
except when for a short time they were in pursuit, towards
Ljuria, of certain invaders. Not only were they legally
entitled to take up their position on the mountains to the
west of the Black Drin, but the Moslem tribes, the Malizi
and the Ljuri, who dwell in that uninviting district, were
most anxious that the Serbs should come and should
remain. For this the tribes had two principal reasons:
in the first place, they recognized that their compatriots
in Djakovica and Prizren were immeasurably better off
than before they came under Serbian rule; and secondly,
they did not wish to be separated from these towns which
are their markets. In fact, they had become so anxious
to throw in their lot with the Slavs that they formed
six battalions, which operated on both banks of the river,
under the command of Bairam Ramadan, Mahmoud
Rejeb and others. In opposition to these battalions were
the troops of the so-called National Government, that of
Tirana. This Government is repudiated by a great many
Albanians on account of its reactionary methods, its subservience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to the Italians, and its failure to do anything
for the people. The battalions, then, were engaged in
1921, not against their immediate neighbours to the west,
the Catholic Mirditi, of whom we shall speak anon, but
against the more distant Government of Tirana. Thus
the League of Nations beheld that the administration
which they were about to confirm as the legitimate
Government of Albania was violently opposed by compact
masses of Catholics and Moslems. Perhaps some of the
members of the League began to doubt whether they
should have accepted the assurance of the Anglo-Albanian
Society that the Tirana Government (containing Moslem,
Catholic and Orthodox members) was really a national
affair; perhaps they began to suspect that the two
Christian elements were only there to throw a little dust
in the eyes of Europe; and perhaps Lord Robert Cecil
began to feel doubtful whether, at the urgent request of
his friend Mr. Aubrey Herbert, President of the Anglo-Albanian
Society, he had been well advised to bring
about the admission into the League of a country which
had two simultaneous Governments before it had a
frontier. Perhaps one was beginning to recognize that
there are Albanians but no Albania.</p>

<p>The emissaries of Tirana might depict as of no importance
the hostilities that were being waged against
them by those Moslem tribes, they might tell the League
of Nations that the Mirdite revolution was not worth
considering. It is a fact that the Mirditi are not very
numerous, but in close connection with their 18,000 people
are the Shala with 500 houses and the Shoshi with 300.
Tradition has it that they are descended from three
brothers who set out from the arid village of Shiroka on
Lake Scutari to seek their fortune. The most ancient,
the most noble and important family of northern Albania
is that of Gjomarkaj, whose seat is at Oroshi, the capital
of the Mirditi. Despite enormous difficulties they succeeded
in maintaining their own position and the prestige
of the Mirditi. They refused to recognize the Turkish
Government and clung so tenaciously to their own usages
and laws, and were so famous for their courage that
the Sultans were eager to grant them privileges and
concessions. Thereafter they promised to assist the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Sultan against external aggression, and always did so
with great success. It was due to the Mirditi that the
Albanian mountaineers preserved their nationality, their
religion and their customs, for they were ever the leaders
of the other Albanian tribes. The most prominent of
the Mirditi in our time have been Prenk Bib Doda, who,
after long years of exile, was assassinated in Albania; Mark
Djoni, now the President of the Mirdite Republic; and,
above all, the great Abbot Monsignor Primo Doci, a man
of vast culture, who returned to his own country after
serving the Vatican as a diplomat in various parts of
the world. It is not surprising that the educational
standard of his native land filled him with the determination
to build schools and that, owing to his efforts, the
Roman Catholic establishment of thirty native priests and
of bishops who were nearly all foreigners has developed
into a body of almost three hundred native priests with no
foreign bishops. A poet himself, he founded the literary
society, <i>Bashkimi l'unione</i>, in which all capable patriots
were invited to collaborate. He constructed more than
twenty strongholds in and around Oroshi, and when he
died in February 1917 it was largely owing to the persecution
which he suffered at the hands of the Austrians.
What has latterly aroused his faithful people is the
persecution levelled at them by the Moslem-Italian
Government of Tirana.</p>

<p>A certain amount of mystery envelopes the death of
Bib Doda; an opinion widely held is that Italians were
responsible, but Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Goad rebukes me in the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i> for not knowing that the Italians laid
aside the crude methods of political murder centuries ago.
Perhaps he doesn't regard the massacre of the helpless
French soldiers at Rieka in 1919 as political murder,
since they were only privates; perhaps he doesn't count
that famous expedition of the five lieutenants to
assassinate Zanella, because it was unsuccessful; but he
may be right concerning Bib Doda. That personage had
been to Durazzo to confer with the Italians; he had
refused to accept an Italian protectorate in Albania, and
on his return he was killed in his carriage before he could
reach Scutari. The chief assailant was a Catholic of
Klementi, believed to be an adherent of Essad Pasha and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
also an Italian "agent d'occasion." Yet as several
Italian soldiers who accompanied Bib Doda were wounded
it would seem that those, myself included, who believed
that this affair had been arranged by the Italians were
wrong.</p>

<p>As for Bib Doda's fortune, Mr. Goad asserts that by
Albanian law he did not have to leave it to his nearest
kinsman, Marko Djoni. That is, I beg to say, precisely
what he had to do according to the custom of their ancient
family. Mr. Goad says that the cash went to the poor;
I say that a good deal of it went into the pocket of a lady
who was much younger than the dead man and was on
excellent terms with an Italian major. If Mr. Goad had
visited Albania at that time and had been interested in
other things besides what he tells us of&mdash;the moonlight
of Klisura and the splendid plane trees over the Vouissa
and the sunrise reflected on the gleaming mountain-wall
of the Nemorica&mdash;I would not have to tell him all this
about Bib Doda's money. He says that Marko Djoni is
a discredited, disgruntled person who became a tool of
the Serbs and fled to Serbia. But he forgets that Bib
Doda was killed in March 1919, and that until May 1921
Marko Djoni remained in Albania, enjoying the friendship
of Italy rather than that of Serbia. In fact it was not
easy for him to abandon this friendship, owing to various
deals in connection with the Mirdite forests. No doubt
he resented the loss of his heritage; but why in the name
of goodness should not he and his followers fight for their
liberty, and why should the Serbs not help them at a time
when the frontiers of Albania had not been fixed nor the
Government officially recognized? The Serbs were helping
him to make war, says Mr. Goad, against his legitimate
rulers. Yet we must be lenient with our Mr. Goad,
for he himself admits that "few can write of Balkan
politics without revealing symptoms of that partisan
disease." He has made up his mind that the Serbs are the
villains of the piece, and there, for him, is the end of it.</p>

<p>A delegation from the Mirditi, consisting of the
Rev. Professor Anthony Achikou and Captain Dod
Ll&eacute;che, came to Geneva in October 1921, and requested
the League not to issue a confirmation of the Tirana
Government. They showed that this Government had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
no other aim than to turn Albania into a small Turkey.
No doubt the Moslems, as the most numerous element,
had a right to have a majority in the Cabinet, but there
was no justification in their appointment of pure Turks.
(The Tirana Government proposed in the autumn of 1921
that any Albanian coming from Turkey, who has held a
public office there, shall be refused admittance into
the Albanian Administration until two years after his
return. This is a proposal but not yet, I believe, an
effective law.) The Minister of Justice has been old
Hodja Kadri, and the Minister of War one Salah el Din
Bey, an officer of Kemal Pasha, and neither of these
was acquainted with the Albanian language. When the
Mirditi started to show their dislike of this Government,
the War Minister commanded his troops to slay without
mercy anyone who dared to raise his voice. Thus it
came about that the villages of Oroshi, Laci, Gomsice and
Naraci were destroyed, while those of the inhabitants
who could escape fled across the frontier to Serbia. As
for particular cases of iniquity we may instance that of
the Moslem officer, Chakir Nizami, who, as a manifestation
of his hatred for the Christians, had violated at
Scutari a girl of fourteen whose name was Chakya Hil
Paloks. He was sentenced by the French military
authorities and was liberated by the Minister of Justice as
soon as the French had quitted Scutari. On the other
hand, Kol Achikou, a brother of the delegate, had killed
a Moslem in self-defence and been acquitted by the
French court martial; after their departure he was
taken to Tirana and sentenced to death. But apart
from all such misdeeds the Mirditi complained that the
Tirana Government, which could not openly wage war
with Serbia, had organized the "Kossovo" Committee,
whose object it was to foment trouble in Serbia and to
send armed bands of marauders on to Serbian territory.
At the very moment when the delegation was at Geneva,
one of these bands (in the night between October 12 and
13) raided the village of Moji&#353;te, near Gostivar. Furnished
with Italian machine guns and bombs they came over
the mountains, set fire to the village and killed many of
the people as they fled. They are accustomed on such
expeditions to steal the children and hold them to ransom&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
lucrative operation which d'Annunzio's arditi<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> may
have copied from their Albanian colleagues. It would
seem, then, according to the statement of the Mirditi,
that in the conflict on the Black Drin, of which Europe
had vaguely heard, the Tirana Government and not that
of Serbia was the aggressor. Mr. Aubrey Herbert may
write pathetic letters to the Press, Miss Durham may
write letters of indignation, but how could their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s
of Tirana be said to be valiantly defending themselves
against the wicked Serbs when the very villages which,
said Mr. Herbert, were destroyed&mdash;Aras and Dardha and
so forth&mdash;were situated in the district to which the Serbs
were legally entitled?</p>

<p>The Mirditi delegates had an interview in Geneva
with Lord Robert Cecil. An attempt was made by the
Tirana delegates to discredit Professor Achikou, by
publishing a telegram from Monsignor Sereggi, the Archbishop
of Scutari (but which the Professor accused the
rival delegate, the bearded, bustling Father Fan Noli,
of having composed himself),<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and in that message it
was stated that Achikou was expelled from Albania.
This he did not deny; he was, he said, one of 4000 who
had been driven out by an arbitrary Government and he
hoped that they would soon be able to return. The
message called Achikou a traitor; but that is a matter
of opinion. It said that he was in the service of a
foreign Power; he replied that the Mirditi had never
concealed their wish to live in friendship with their
neighbours, and the proof that they envisaged nothing
more than friendship was that they were petitioning the
League to recognize the Mirdite Republic. Among the
other charges against Achikou was one which said that
he was sailing under false colours. This was an absurd
accusation, and one which enabled the reverend Father
to mention that his opponent Monsignor, who was then
being called Bishop, Fan Noli, was neither a bishop nor
an Albanian, but a simple priest, a Greek from Adrianople,
whose real name was Theophanus.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This clever man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>who had decided to form an Orthodox Albanian Church
and had apparently become its bishop without the
formality of consecration, had enjoyed some success at
Geneva owing to his knowledge of languages. He circulated
a telegram from Tirana which purported to be a
disavowal of the Mirditi delegation by a number of
Mirditi notables; but a reply was sent by Mark Djoni,
the President of the Mirdite Republic, an elderly man of
great sagacity and experience, for in Turkish times he
had been chief magistrate of the Mirditi. He pointed
out that all the notables and all the tribal chieftains had
gone, like himself, into exile, and that the names were
those of insignificant persons who had acted under fear
of death. Djoni did not in this telegram allude to the
position of those Catholic priests and others in northern
Albania who support the Tirana Government and its
Italian paymasters; some of them may believe that
they are acting in the interest of their country&mdash;to act
otherwise would be perilous, and everyone seems to know
the precise number of napoleons a month&mdash;ranging from
the 150 of an ecclesiastical magnate down to 7&frac12; (the pay
of a simple gendarme)&mdash;which they are alleged to receive.
Do they ever think of the starving Italian peasants?</p>

<p>On October 7 another telegram was sent from Oroshi
(the capital of the Mirditi) to the Tirana Delegation
which "protested energetically against the activities of
a certain Anthony Achikou." Yet, on October 9, an
individual called Notz Pistuli, who had travelled specially
from Scutari, presented himself at the Mirdite delegates'
hotel, and in the name of the Scutari National Council
asked whether a reconciliation could not be made between
the Mirditi and the Tirana Government.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Being told
that the Mirditi would have nothing to do with the
Turkish Government of Tirana, he held out hopes that
another Government more representative of Albania
would soon be constituted. It was remarkable that
Tirana should have dispatched this envoy after giving
out that the Mirditi were traitors and that their delegates
represented nobody.</p>

<p>Lord Robert Cecil did not at first seem to think that
their desire for a republic independent of Tirana could be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>gratified, but on being initiated into the facts of the
case and told that definitely to reject them would look
as if he were a foe to Christianity, Lord Robert said
that such was far from being the case. He would do
whatever he could to help them. And on the next day
it was decided that, in accordance with the Mirdite
request, a Commission should proceed to Albania.</p>

<p>The Italian delegate, Marquis Imperiali, submitted
that there was no need to hurry this Commission and
Monsieur Djoni explained in a telegram<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that if the
Commission went forthwith it would discover in Albania
cannons, rifles and other war material from Italy, that
it would find numerous Turkish officers of the Kemalist
army who had been brought from Asia Minor in Italian
ships, and that it would perceive that the cannons, the
Turkish Government of Tirana, the rifles, the Turkish
officers, certain Catholic ecclesiastics&mdash;in a word, the
whole of Albania such as it is to-day is nothing else, said
he, but a masked Italian instrument of war against
Serbia&mdash;while all the bloody consequences of this perpetual
struggle have to be endured by the border population....
One afternoon, at the beginning of November,
650 Tirana soldiers, pursued by the Mirditi, gave themselves
up to the Serbian authorities on the Black Drin.
They had with them a dozen officers of whom two were
Italians, and these accounted for themselves by saying
that they had come out to organize and to lead the
Albanian army.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">Now, would this be the best solution of the Albanian
problem, that the Mirdite Republic and that of Tirana
should both be recognized, since it is quite clear that it
would be immoral&mdash;and very useless&mdash;for Europe to try
to persuade the Mirditi to place themselves under the
Tirana r&eacute;gime? But there appears to be no doubt
that the Moslems of northern Albania&mdash;however much
they may now sympathize with the Mirditi in their
attitude towards Tirana&mdash;would just as strenuously resist
their own incorporation in a Christian Republic....
Down at the bottom of their hearts all the Albanian
delegates who came to Geneva must know that if an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>Albanian State is larger than one tribe it will go to pieces.
Whatever good qualities may be latent in the Albanian,
he is as yet&mdash;with rare exceptions&mdash;in that stage of culture
which has no idea of duty on the part of the State or of
duty towards the State. As an example of his views on
the exercise of authority we may instance the case of the
82 Albanians, led by Islam Aga Batusha (of the village
of Voksha), who stopped Pouni&#353;a Ra&#269;i&#263; and his companions
in the summer of 1921 while they were riding one
day from Djakovica to Pe&#263;. Pouni&#353;a enjoys the fullest
confidence of the border tribes because he has never been
known to break his word; they are very conscious that
even their vaunted "besa" is not nowadays observed
as it was, say fifty years ago, for the Austrian and Italian
propaganda schools have had an unfortunate effect.
Well, as the 82 sat round Pouni&#353;a and his friends in the
courtyard of a mosque, where they spent the whole day
confabulating, they said they hoped that he, a just and
wise man, would help them; and their principal grievance
was that the Serbian police no longer allowed them to kill
each other. Why should the police interfere in their
private affairs? Recently the police had arrested a man
whom one of these protesters wanted to kill, and therefore
he thought he would have to kill one of the police. Even
those who have spent their lives in Serbia are too often
at this stage of development&mdash;a few years ago, in the
village of Prokuplje, an Albanian assassinated his neighbour
and was sentenced to twenty years' penal servitude.
The judge asked the dead man's brother if he was satisfied.
"No, I am not," he answered, "because now I shall
have to wait twenty years to kill him." Their ancient
custom of blood-vengeance continues to flourish, though
in Serbia the police and public opinion are against it;
thus, at Luka, in the department of Pe&#263;, one Alil Mahmoud
was murdered by a Berisha to avenge his uncle, so that
now the sons of this Mahmoud propose to kill a Berisha&mdash;not
the murderer, but one equal in rank to their late
father, and in consequence Ahmed Beg, son of Murtezza
Pasha, of Djakovica, is afraid to leave his house, which
the Serbian police, at his request, is guarding.</p>

<p>How much the Albanian conceives that he owes a
duty to the State may be instanced by the application of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
a smuggler that he be granted a permit to go to Zagreb
in order to dispose of 6000 oka<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of tobacco which he had
brought over the frontier. He was talking to a Serb
who has the confidence of the Albanians because he does
not treat them as if they were Serbs; and when this
father confessor advised him to get rid of the tobacco
locally (which he succeeded in doing) the Albanian
objected that the excise officers gave him constant
anxiety, they were thieves who insisted on payment
being made to them if they came across his merchandise.
And if it be said that this is too humble a case, we may
mention that of Ali Riza, one of the chief officers of the
Tirana army which was last year operating against the
Serbs. So indifferent is he as to the uniform he bears that
the year before last, in Vienna, he begged an influential
Serb to recommend him for a lieutenancy in the Serbian
army. (His request was not granted because it was
ascertained that, besides being unable to read and write,
his work as an Austrian gendarme had been more zealous
than creditable.)</p>


<p class="section">12. SERBIA'S GOOD INFLUENCE</p>

<p>What, then, is Europe to do with these wild children
of hers?... The tribes, Catholic and Moslem, who
dwell between the Big Drin and the frontier allotted to
Serbia in 1913, asked the aforesaid Pouni&#353;a in 1919 to
intervene in their quarrels; and the result was that a
small number of Serbian soldiers were scattered about
that country. They were placed at the disposal of the
chief, whom they assisted in maintaining order. (Needless
to say, they collected no taxes or recruits, and all
their supplies came to them from Serbia.) The people
were impressed not only by the uniform but by the
men's conduct. Before going to these posts&mdash;where
they were relieved every two or three months&mdash;the men
were instructed with regard to Albanian customs, and
no case occurred of any transgression. So rigidly did
they enforce the precept that anyone who tried to violate
or carry off a woman was, if he persisted, to be shot, that
last year, at Tropolje in Gashi, when the girl in question
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>was said to be not unwilling, they pursued the abductors,
and in the subsequent battle there were fatalities on
both sides. The Serbian soldiers, for whose safety the
village was responsible, made themselves so popular that
when the Tirana Government appointed one Niman Feriz
to go to those parts as sub-prefect he was chased away
by the people headed by the mayor of the Krasnichi, who
is a nephew of Bairam Beg Zur, the illiterate ex-brigand
and ex-Minister of War of the Tirana Government.</p>

<p>Let this system of small Serbian posts be extended
over the whole of northern Albania, that is to say, in those
districts where the natives are willing to receive them.
After all, the Serbs understand these neighbours of theirs.
Telephones and roads will be built and eventually the
railway along the Drin. The northern Albanians will
then, for the first time, be on the high-road towards peace
and prosperity; and if the rest of Albania has by then
attained to anything like this condition everybody would
be glad to see a free and independent Albania.</p>

<p>Now what prospect is there of the rest of Albania
taking any analogous steps? If the regions which at
present submit to Tirana decline to modify their methods,
it would seem that warfare between them and their
kinsmen to the north and north-east must continue, and
that the foundations of a united, free Albania will not
yet be laid. One might presume, from their bellicose
attitude, that the Tirana Government (extending to and
including the town of Scutari) is all against a pacific
solution; and if one argues that their attitude would be
quite different without the support they receive from
Italy, then the Italians would doubtless reply that they
have as much right to assist the Tirana Albanians as
Yugoslavia has to assist those of the north.</p>

<p>But this is not the case. Between Italy and the
Albanians there are no such ancient political and economic
ties as between the Albanians and the Serbs. The
medi&aelig;val connection with Venice has left with many
Albanians a dolorous memory, for apart from the fact
that Venice, as in Dalmatia, was pursuing a merely selfish
policy, it was directly due to her that the Turkish Sultan,
in the fifteenth century, was able to establish himself
in Albania. Thrice his troops had been repelled by those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of Skanderbeg when the arrangement was made for
them to enter the fortress of Rosafat in Venetian uniforms,
and then four hundred years elapsed before the Sultan's
standard was pulled down. In recent times the Government
of Italy has been furnishing the Shqyptart with
schools, and these were not its only acts of benevolence
towards that wretched people. They have given schools
and rifles and munitions and gold. The Albanians were
willing to accept this largesse; but that it forged a link
between patron and client, that it conferred on the
Italians any rights to occupy the country, they denied,
and enforced this denial in 1920 at the point of the bayonet.
Mr. H. Goad said in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> that this
remark of mine is quite unhistorical, since Italy, says he,
"was in course of withdrawal when certain Albanians,
stirred up as usual by Jugo-Slavs, attacked her retreating
troops." If the Albanians had only known that Italy,
despite her having been, says Mr. Goad, "supremely
useful to Albania," had resolved to quit, they would
perhaps have let them go with dignity. But if Mr.
Goad will read some of the contemporary Italian newspapers
he will see that my allusion to the bayonet was
much too mild. Utterly regardless of the fact that the
Italian evacuation was "according to plan," the Shqyptart
treated them abominably&mdash;it brought up memories
of Abyssinia&mdash;or does Mr. Goad deny that even a general
officer was outraged and blew out his brains? This
Albanian onslaught was so far from being stirred up by
the Yugoslavs that, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the Belgrade
Government refused to furnish them with munitions.
This is not to say that they did not approve of the Albanian
push, for they maintain, in spite of Mr. Goad, the principle
of "The Balkans for the Balkan Peoples." If Italy, as our
strange publicist asserts, has a mandate&mdash;presumably a
moral one&mdash;to defend Albania against aggression he will
find, I think, that the Yugoslavs heartily agree with
this thesis and that they are also quite determined to
defend Albania from aggression.... When he asserts
that various ties existed between Italy and the Albanians&mdash;the
Albanian language, the feudal architecture, much
that is characteristic in Albanian art and so forth&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>would refer him to M. Justin Godart, with whom I am
glad for once to be in agreement. "There is no traditional
or actual link," says he, "between the two countries;
if, on account of this geographical position, they propose
to have commercial relations, then everything has yet
to be established. If there is to be a friendship, we
believe that Italy must do her best to wipe out many
memories.... She has not profited from the large
number of Albanians in her southern provinces in order
to have an Albanian policy."</p>

<p>However, the magnanimous Italians came back,
declaring that on this occasion they would not occupy
the country (except the little island of Saseno); but
that they really could not restrain themselves from bestowing
the schools, the rifles, munitions and gold. Once
more the Albanians agreed to accept them; they also
accepted the Turkish officers and officials whom the
Italian ships brought to them from Asia Minor, and when
their Government became more and more Turkish and
more intractable they found that they had excited the
hostility of large numbers of their own compatriots.
This developed during 1921 into violent conflicts; and
the bountiful Italians provided the Tirana Government's
army with expert tuition. Nevertheless, in the Albanians'
opinion, there are no bonds between the two
races, and if the Italians would retire from Albania,
permitting the Balkans to be for the Balkan peoples,
and if the fanatical Turks went back to Asia Minor, it
would soon be seen that the present rage between
northern and central Albania would peter out into the
isolated murders which the Albanians have hitherto been
unable to dispense with. Left to themselves the Albanians
of Tirana would eventually ask for some such assistance
from Serbia as the northern tribes have received; three
months after the departure of the Italians from Scutari
a plebiscite would show that this town, which has lately
gone so far as to refuse&mdash;yes, even her Moslems have
refused&mdash;to fill the depleted ranks of the Tirana forces,
was anxious to come to a friendly settlement with her
Albanian neighbours and the Yugoslavs. This would be
a victory of Scutari's common sense over all those fanatics
and intriguers whose activities involve her death; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
she cannot possibly thrive if she persists in cutting herself
off from the hinterland and from the benefits that will
accrue from the canalization of the Bojana.</p>

<p>However, the Italians&mdash;officially or unofficially&mdash;will
not yet awhile leave Albania. And how will this retard
or modify the reasonableness of those parts which acknowledge
Tirana? As for the town of Scutari, it is probable
that if she found herself permanently cut off by the
Mirditi from direct communication with Tirana she
would allow her incipient independence to come more to
the surface. With Tirana less capable of enforcing her
behests the Scutarenes would gradually venture to act
in their own interests; they would aim at local autonomy
within the sphere of Yugoslav influence and in the same
sphere as their markets. It is to be hoped that Yugoslavia
will be prepared for this, since she does not possess
too many educated citizens who understand the Albanian
mentality. A course of conduct which pays no attention
to this would alienate even the Turks from Podgorica
and Dulcigno, whose acquaintance with the very language
of Albania is so limited. There seems, however, to be
no reason why the mixed population of Albanian Moslems
and Catholics, of Orthodox Serbs and of Moslems who
declined to come under the all-too-patriarchal rule of
Nicholas of Montenegro should not have the same happy
experience as the inhabitants of Djakovica and Prizren.
Later on the Scutarenes will be called upon to decide
whether they prefer, like those other predominantly
Albanian towns, to remain in Yugoslavia or whether they
wish to throw in their lot with a free Albania, and in
that case their town would become the capital of the
country. Failing Scutari, the capital would most probably
be Oroshi, which is now the capital of the Mirditi.</p>

<p>And why, we may be asked, why should not Tirana be
the capital? In the central parts of Albania, in the
country round Tirana, where the natives are derisively
called "llape" by the warriors of the north and by the
cultured Albanians of the south, we believe that the
assistance of Italy will be unable to prevent a collapse.
(It must also be remembered that the people of the
district of Tirana are, for the most part, in opposition
to the present Tirana Government. This became clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
when the partisans of Essad Pasha's policy<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> overthrew
and imprisoned the Tirana Ministers.) Economically
and morally Tirana will decline, until she is compelled to
seek a union with the people of northern Albania, those
of the south having meanwhile gravitated towards
Greece. Then the moment will arrive when the north
and the south, in their task of building up a free and
united Albania, will admit the centre under various
conditions. These will have to be of a rather stern
character, or so at any rate they will seem to the folk
of Tirana: taxes will have to be paid, military service or
service in the <i>gendarmerie</i> will have to be rendered, and
schools will have to be established for both sexes.</p>

<p>This, then, is the future country of Albania, which&mdash;if
one is rash enough to prophesy&mdash;may exist in fifty years.
But there is no risk whatever in asserting that a free,
united Albania is in the immediate future quite impossible.</p>


<p class="section">13. EUROPEAN MEASURES AGAINST THE YUGOSLAVS
AND THEIR FRIENDS</p>

<p>Berati Beg, Tirana's delegate in Paris, said in an
interview with a representative of the Belgrade <i>Pravda</i>,
at the beginning of November 1921, that he regretted
that European diplomats should interfere in the Serbo-Albanian
question. "Are we not all," said he, "one
large Balkan family? And if the Powers intervene they
will not act in our interests, but in their own." He said
that it used to be Austria which grasped at Albania, now
it was Italy. So the delegate showed that he was a clear-sighted
man; he also showed that in Tirana they are
not unanimous in loving the Italians. But alas! the
Great Powers, urged by Italy, made a most disastrous
plunge; they actually, at least Great Britain, charged
the Serbs, their allies, on November 7, with being guilty
of overstepping the frontier, and on November 9 informed
them where this frontier was. It is a pity that Mr.
Lloyd George should have launched such a thunderbolt,
the French Government not being consulted.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> But the
most probable explanation of this lack of courtesy towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>the Serbs, and lack of the most elementary justice, is that
the Prime Minister, with his numerous preoccupations,
allowed some incapable person to act in his name.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The
world was told, however, that Mr. Lloyd George had sent
a peremptory demand for the convocation of the Council
of the League of Nations so that a sanction should be
applied against the Yugoslavs. Mr. Lloyd George's
substitute was so little versed in the business that he did
not even know that the League of Nations is not a gendarme
to carry out the decisions of the Ambassadors'
Conference. He should have been aware of the fact that
this was a problem for the Allied States, to be settled by
diplomatic or other measures, and he should also have
known that the League of Nations does not&mdash;except if
invited to arbitrate&mdash;concern itself with the unliquidated
problems left by the War, such as the Turkish question.
Perhaps that dangerous confusion in the mind of this
unknown official would not have occurred if Albania had
not been illogically admitted to the League of Nations.
But now, in November 1921, not an instant was to be
lost in settling this frontier question, which&mdash;as the <i>Temps</i>
pointed out&mdash;would have been settled months before if
Italy had not prevented it. (She wished as a preliminary
step to have certain claims of her own in regard to Albania
conceded.) So the Council of the League was to be invited
to apply Article 16, which could scarcely be invoked
unless Article 15, which defines a procedure of conciliation,
had been found of no avail.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Thus the misguided person
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>who spoke in the name of Mr. Lloyd George was apparently
too impetuous to read the texts. And then the
Serbs were told that they must withdraw practically to
the frontier which Austria, their late enemy, had laid
down in 1913. Well might Berati Beg deplore that Italy
should take the place of Austria. But such commands
achieve so little. Very soon, when the troubles in
Albania continue, as they certainly will, Mr. Lloyd George
will see that he was misled.... But here it should be
stated that while Italy persisted throughout in demanding
the 1913 frontier (with the ludicrously inconsistent
proviso that she herself should have the island of Saseno,
which in 1913 she had demanded for independent Albania),
and France raised no finger against her, the actual improvements
of the frontier adopted were entirely due to
Great Britain. No one is more qualified to speak on this
matter than Mr. Harold Temperley of Cambridge, who
was one of our experts. In his illuminating little book,
<i>The Second Year of the League</i>, he has pointed out that
the new Albanian frontiers are an improvement on the
old&mdash;than which, indeed, they cannot be worse&mdash;because
they conform more to natural features, they
take into account an important tribal boundary (leaving
the Gora tribe in Yugoslavia), and restore to both
parties freedom of communication&mdash;the road between the
Serb towns of Struga and Dibra being given to the Serbs,
while to Albania is given the road from Elbasan to the
Serb town of Lin. The rectifications in the Kastrati
and the Prizren area involve the substitution of natural
boundaries for unnatural ones in order to protect the
cities of Podgorica and Prizren. They confer no offensive
advantage on the Serbs, nor do they enable them to menace
any Albanian city.</p>

<p>To any impartial observer it is quite unjust that
the Yugoslavs should have had to plead against the
frontier of 1913. They have not the least desire to plant
their flag on those undelectable mountains. If the
frontier of 1913 could be held with moderate efforts
against these people they would not wish to go an inch
beyond it. But those who drew this frontier, namely the
Austrians, were not much concerned as to whether it
afforded adequate protection to the Serbs; what they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
had in view was to keep them away from the Adriatic
(for which reason an arbitrary line cut through the proposed
railway which was to link Pe&#263; to Podgorica and the
sea) and to compel the Serbs to station in those districts
a goodly portion of their army, to which end&mdash;so that
the frontier should be weak&mdash;the towns of Djakovica
and Prizren were separated from their hinterland. The
Austrian plan likewise prevented the towns of Struga and
Prizren from being joined by a road or by a railway along
the Drin; to go from one to the other it became necessary
to make an enormous detour. With the rectifications
to which we have referred, the Ambassadors' Conference
decided to insist on them returning to this miserable line,
instead of permitting them to take up their position where
General Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey perceived in 1918 that they
could be fairly comfortable. Monsieur Albert Mousset,
the shrewd Balkan expert of the <i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i>, has
remarked that on too many parts of the 1913 frontier it
is as if one forced an honest man to sleep with his door
open among a horde of bandits.... The Albanian
Government, admitted to the League of Nations in
December 1920, claimed that the international statute
of 1913, creating a German prince, the Dutch <i>gendarmerie</i>
and the International Financial Commission&mdash;which
happened to be inconvenient&mdash;was no longer in force;
but that the international decisions as to the frontiers of
Albania&mdash;which happened to be convenient&mdash;were still
valid. However, during the War the country had been
plunged in anarchy, and the Great Powers decided that
Albania was, in Mr. Temperley's words, a <i>tabula rasa</i>, a
piece of white paper on which they could write what they
wished. In November 1921 the Ambassadors' Conference
finally decided on the frontiers. The gravest
violation of the ethnic principle was in the Argyrocastro
area, where many thousands of Greeks and Grecophils
were handed over to Albania; as for the Serbs, it was
only through the efforts of some British experts that
they obtained any satisfaction at all.</p>

<p>Why did the Ambassadors' Conference arrive at this
peculiar decision? For a long time the European Press
had been publishing telegrams which told how the Serbs
were ruthlessly invading Albania. Had they advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
about half the number of miles with which they were
credited, they would have found themselves near to the
offices of those Italian Press agencies. They were held
up to vituperation for their conduct towards a feeble
neighbour. The Mirditi, we were told, had to fly before
them; whereas the truth was that the friendly Mirditi
were driving the troops of Tirana helter-skelter towards
the Black Drin, where the Serbs&mdash;not advancing an inch
from the boundary which the Allies had for the time being
assigned to them&mdash;received their prisoners. Again we
were told that the piratical Serbs had seized the town of
Alessio. It must have annoyed the Mirditi to have this
exploit of theirs ascribed to other people. And if the
newspapers contained too many telegrams of this kind
they were strangely reticent with regard to what was
taking place in the shallow Albanian harbours; but the
two Italian vessels which&mdash;as I mentioned in a telegram
to the <i>Observer</i>&mdash;were unloading, without the least concealment,
munitions and rifles for the dear Albanians at
San Giovanni di Medua in September 1920, were probably
not the only ones with such a cargo. Europe and the
Ambassadors' Conference were simply told that the
truculent Serbs were destroying a poor, defenceless,
pastoral nation. Therefore these Serbs must be ordered
back, and whatever might be the merits of a hostile
Austrian frontier as compared with a well-informed
French one, at any rate the first of these was farther back,
so let the Serbs be ordered thither.</p>

<p>It was noticeable that when, on November 17, the
British Minister of Education, Mr. H.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;L. Fisher (representing
Mr. Lloyd George), explained before the Council
of the League of Nations why Great Britain had thought
it necessary to act in this Serbo-Albanian affair, he
founded his case not on Article 16 but on Article 12,
which obliges two conflicting nations who are members
of the League to have their case examined by the League.
Evidently the suggested application of Article 16 was
now acknowledged to have been a mistake. The blundering
official in Whitehall should have seen the dignified
sorrow with which Yugoslavia heard of her great Ally's
unjustifiable procedure. So much faith have the Southern
Slavs always had in the Entente's sense of justice that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
from 1914 to 1918 they continued to give their all, without
making any agreement or stipulation; more than once
the Serbian Government had the offer of terms from the
Central Powers, but on each occasion, as for example
during the dark days at Ni&#353; in 1915, they declined to
betray their Allies.</p>

<p>Mr. Fisher announced that the British Government's
action was in no way caused by feelings of hostility
against the Southern Slavs. All Englishmen, in fact,
remembered the heroism and fortitude of the Serbs;
they cherished for Yugoslavia the warmest sympathy.
In Mr. Fisher's own case it might conceivably have been
a little warmer&mdash;he was not ashamed to repeat the reasons
which had induced Great Britain to summon the Council
of the League. Yet he must have known the comment
that he would arouse among his audience when they
heard him base his arguments exclusively upon reports
of the Tirana Government, while those of Belgrade were
ignored; and in their place the delegate thought fit to
bring up various extracts which had been collected from
the Belgrade Press. If every organ of this Press were
filled with a permanent sense of high responsibility, and
if Mr. Fisher had made inquiries as to the existence in
Belgrade of humorous and ironic writers, one is still
rather at a loss to understand why these miscellaneous
cuttings were placed before the League, which could
scarcely be expected to treat them as evidence. The
delegate added that he did not think a single nation was
animated by unfriendly sentiments towards the Southern
Slavs&mdash;so that Italy's unflagging efforts to strengthen
the Tirana Government's army were prompted purely
by the deep love which the Italians&mdash;despite their having
been flung out of Valona&mdash;bear for the Shqyptart. Mr.
Fisher proceeded to say that no better proof was needed
of the general friendship for the Southern Slavs than
the decision of the Ambassadors' Conference which,
instead of allotting to Albania the frontiers of 1913, a
method that would have been simpler, had resolved on
several rectifications in favour of Yugoslavia, in order
to prevent disturbances on Albania's northern frontier.
After what Mr. Fisher had already had the heart to say
we cannot really be astonished that he, or the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
on behalf of whom he spoke, should have thought the
enemy-drawn frontier of 1913 as worthy of the slightest
consideration. We are all, I think, unanimous, said Mr.
Fisher in effect, we are unanimous in our esteem for the
Yugoslavs and could do nothing which that nation would
find hard to bear. But after stating that some rectifications
had been made in favour of Yugoslavia he should
have referred to the village of Lin on Lake Ochrida
whose transference to the Albanians will probably give
rise to a great deal of trouble, since it is the most important
centre for the fishing industry. A few of the best Belgrade
papers, careless of the more than Governmental authority
which they enjoyed in the eyes of Mr. Fisher, went so
far as to allege that Lin's change of sovereignty was due
to the formation on Lake Ochrida of a British fishing
company.... We have said that the frontier rectifications
were inadequate; but under the circumstances
they were the best that could be obtained. They were
most bitterly contested by the Italians, who demanded,
as we have said above, that Yugoslavia should be given the
1913 frontier. France did nothing to help the Yugoslavs
in this hour of need, and had it not been for the absolutely
determined support of Great Britain the pernicious frontier
of 1913 would have been adopted intact.</p>

<p>Coming to the Mirdite revolt, Mr. Fisher's description
is hardly what you would call felicitous. Mark Djoni
and the other members of the Mirdite Government were
compelled last July to seek refuge at Prizren in Yugoslavia,
and since then they have conducted their affairs
from that place. These circumstances, in Mr. Fisher's
opinion, go to prove the existence of a Yugoslav plot
whose aim it is to separate northern Albania from the
Tirana Government. Again Mr. Fisher points an accusing
finger at the Yugoslav officers who, in August, were
helping the Mirditi; but is it not more natural that
these officers should give their services to the Christian
tribes for whom, as Mr. Bo&#353;kovi&#263;, the chief Yugoslav
delegate, said, the Southern Slavs do not conceal their
sympathy<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> nor the hope that they will gain the necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>autonomy&mdash;is not this more natural and more deserving
of Mr. Fisher's approbation than the fact (of which he
says no word) that the Moslem Government of Tirana
has had the active assistance of Italian officers, such, for
example, as Captain Guisardi, who, in the sector of
Kljesh, has been in command of the artillery? A further
proof that the Mirdite movement has been engineered
by the Southern Slavs is, in Mr. Fisher's opinion, the
damning fact that the Republic's Proclamation was
composed in Yugoslavia and dated there&mdash;how brazen
some people are! And the official Yugoslav Press
Bureau has actually circulated the announcements of the
Mirdite Republic. The question is whether the Yugoslav
Government was more than benevolently neutral in thus
assisting their guests at a time when these had not yet
got their machinery into working order. When the
Mirdite Government had made suitable arrangements it
spoke to the world through its representatives at Geneva
or through direct communications to the British and
French Press. Surely, in considering whether the Yugoslav
Government allowed themselves to exceed the
limits of neutrality, one must remember that the Mirdite
authorities at Prizren were out of all touch with their
own army, which was engaged in a guerilla warfare. In
conclusion, according to Mr. Fisher, the British Foreign
Office was persuaded that the Mirdite Republic was
nothing but an instrument of the <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Yuglosav'">Yugoslav</ins> Government,
and that desire for Albanian unity extended also to the
Christians of that country. The Foreign Office had, no
doubt, been told that the Tirana Government received
the support, at last spring's elections, of some north
Albanian deputies; and possibly they gave no credence
to the rumour that these gentlemen were much indebted
to Italian support. It may have been mere harmless
curiosity which kept Captain Pericone, the Italian commander,
during all that day at the Scutari polling-booths,
but what is certain is that, owing to the influx of Italian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>money, the value of a hundred silver crowns in the
morning was 92 lire, and in the afternoon had fallen to
75. It is likewise a fact that numerous Malissori, finding
themselves for the first time in possession of bundles of
paper and feeling far from confident that this was money,
hurried off to the bazaar and spent it all. Thus were
the four friends of the Moslem-Italian<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Government
elected, the four deputies who were in favour of Albanian
unity under that Government; three of them are
Christians (Messrs. Fichta, Andreas Miedia and Luigi
Gurakuqi); one, Riza Dani, is a Moslem. How the
latter travelled to Tirana I do not know, but the three
Christians found that the population was so incensed
against them that they could not go by the direct road;
they were forced to sail down the Bojana on the Italian
ship <i>Mafalda</i>, and then along the coast. This, I presume,
will be considered sufficiently strong evidence that these
deputies did not represent the people, and that their
independence was not exactly of the sort ascribed to
Gurakuqi by a writer in the <i>Times</i>;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> one need not labour
the point by mentioning what happened to Father Vincent
Pr&ecirc;nnushi whose candidature was vetoed in Rome, so
that he was replaced by Father Fichta.</p>

<p>This being the state of things one can scarcely argue
that the people of the north are in favour of a united
Albania, as it seemeth good to the Ambassadors' Conference,
the League of Nations, etc. "We Germans,
knowing Germany and France," said Treitschke in 1871,
"know what is good for the Alsatians better than these
unfortunates themselves.... Against their will we
wish to restore them to themselves." The north
Albanian deputies may join with those of the south
and call themselves the group of "sacred union"; but
they themselves are well aware that it is only in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>south-central districts that the Government has a
majority. That is one of the reasons why the seat of
Government is Tirana in the central part of the country,
for the Cabinet lives in apprehension of the followers of
the late Essad Pasha, and by residing in that country
they hope to be able to keep it quiet. How long will
they be able to do so? Have they statesmanship enough
to turn aside the animosity of their own countrymen?
Does their Premier and Foreign Minister, Mr. Pandeli
Evangheli, possess intellectual resources of a higher
order than those which one commonly associates with
the ownership of a small wine-shop?&mdash;that was his
occupation till he came, some two years ago, from
Bucharest. When this gentleman had a, perhaps temporary,
fall from power, the <i>Times</i> of December 16, 1921,
wrote of him that "there is no Albanian public man
with a better record for long disinterested service in his
country's cause." Alas, poor Albania! We may surmise
that Mr. Evangheli and his companions do not
rely very greatly on their Western European patrons
who, when it comes to the pinch, will do very little for
them. I should be surprised to hear that they have
caused the provisions of the Ambassadors' Conference
to be traced in golden letters on a wall of their council
chamber. And I doubt whether they take very great
stock of a resolution signed in November 1921, by some
twenty Members of Parliament and a few outside persons.
These expressed their approval of Mr. Lloyd George's step
in convoking the League of Nations for the settlement
of the Serbo-Albanian question. If this resolution served
no other purpose it showed, at any rate, that the signatories
are such thoroughgoing friends of the Tirana
Government that they rushed enthusiastically to their
assistance, though their deep knowledge of affairs&mdash;without
which, of course, they would never have signed&mdash;must
have caused them to regard the Prime Minister's
impulsive action with something more than misgiving.
It is a minor point that the signatories sought to enlist
the world's sympathy on the ground that a small "neutral
State" had been wantonly attacked by the Serbs, because
if this accusation were true it would not be worth objecting
that the Albanians were scarcely a State (though some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of them were trying to make one) and that their neutrality
during the War consisted in the fact that they were to be
found both in the armies of the Entente and&mdash;rather more
of them, I believe&mdash;in those of Austria. But the accusation
is untrue; there are, undoubtedly, a number of
fire-eaters in Serbia, as everywhere else, yet the Government
is not so childish as to wish to squander its resources
in a region where there is so little to be gained. (The
Tirana correspondent of <i>The Near East</i> said on November 3,
1921, that the Serbian Government was reported to be
committing unwarrantable acts, giving as an example
that Commandant Martinovi&#263; had had six million dinars
placed at his disposal in order to recruit komitadjis and
that he had himself promised 2500 dinars to each of
his men if they succeeded in entering Scutari. But
this gentleman, a retired officer, lives almost exclusively
at Novi Sad, where his very beautiful daughter is married
to M. Dunjarski, one of the wealthiest men in Yugoslavia.
Yet neither his son-in-law nor the Serbian Government has
ever given General Martinovi&#263; the afore-mentioned sum
or any sum at all for the afore-mentioned purpose. He
goes at rare intervals to his old home in Montenegro, of
which country he was once Prime Minister. It is natural
that the numerous refugees from Albania should flock
round him&mdash;in view of his own past prominence and of
M. Dunjarski&mdash;begging for money and food.) The
protesting British Members of Parliament registered their
sorrow that the Serbs should have employed on their
anti-Albanian enterprise "the strength and riches which
they largely owed to the Allied and Associated Powers."
I was under the impression that the Serbs had expended
a far greater proportion of their strength and riches
than any of the Allies,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that the Allies had, in 1915, left
them in the lurch, and that the final success on the Macedonian
front was due quite considerably to the genius of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>Marshal Mi&#353;i&#263; and the valour of his veterans. As for
the strength and riches which the Southern Slavs possessed
in 1921, it surely would not need an expert to
perceive what the Southern Slav children knew very well,
namely, that they could be more profitably employed in
many other directions. May better luck attend the
future labours of these Members of Parliament.... A
week or so before the publication of this foolish manifesto
there had been issued an equally deplorable Memorandum
by the Balkan Committee (of London), which,
I am glad to say, caused Dr. Seton-Watson to resign from
that body. This jejune and impudent Memorandum
attempted to dictate the terms of the Constitution of the
Triune Kingdom&mdash;an attempt very rightly reprobated
by <i>The Near East</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> If the Yugoslav Government were
to adopt the recommendations of the Balkan Committee
they would, it seems, be in a fair way to solve the Albanian
question. Likewise that of Macedonia&mdash;when will the
Committee cease to trouble Macedonia? Their object,
in the words of Mr. Noel Buxton, is to aim at allaying the
unrest in the Balkans; it would&mdash;I say it in all kindliness&mdash;be
a move in that direction if the other members
were to follow Dr. Seton-Watson's example.</p>

<p>What of the population which inhabits the zone
between the two frontier lines? We have alluded to
them as a horde of bandits, we have also spoken of the
six battalions which they placed at the disposal of the
Yugoslavs. If it is true that a poet has died in the
bosom of most of us, it is equally true that in most of
the Albanians a brigand survives. And if not a brigand,
then a medi&aelig;val person with characteristics which are
more pleasant to read about than to encounter. Yet the
Shqyptar, as he calls himself (which means the eagle's
son) is not without his aspirations. Reference has been
made to those northern tribes, such as the Merturi and
the Gashi, who benefited from the small Serbian detachments
which came in answer to their urgent wish. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>on the Black Drin the six battalions have shown their
fidelity. There would be no need to guard oneself against
such people. But unfortunately the Albanian is so constituted
that if, in a hamlet of ten houses, five of them
are amicably disposed towards you, there is a strong
tendency among the others to be hostile. When these
torch-bearers of an ancient tradition come under the rule
of an organized State, then they gradually feel inclined
to discard some of their customs which the State frowns
upon. This can be seen in the changes among the people
of Kossovo since it came into Serbian hands. Were
the country between the two frontier lines to remain
under the Serbs it would not be long before some of the
time-honoured sensitiveness of the Albanians towards
each other and towards each others' friends would vanish&mdash;though
it has been found that it takes a number of
years before they cease observing or from desiring to
observe the very deeply-rooted custom of blood-vengeance.</p>

<p>A good many of the border Albanians have made it
clear that they wish for some sort of association with
their more cultured neighbours. But on this point they
are by no means unanimous. The unregenerate part of
the people will not be able to resist an occasional foray
into Yugoslavia. And although the reputation which
the Serbs have left behind them may induce the tribes
to be, for the most part, good neighbours, yet they have
not been long enough under the civilizing process, and
the more advanced among them would agree with the
Yugoslavs that it would have been better for that r&eacute;gime
to have continued over them. You may object that
the finest patriots of the Albanians would have preferred
to remain outside Yugoslavia. But they know that there
are many thousands of their contented countryfolk in
the neighbouring Kossovo and, what is more, they know
that the towns of Kossovo are their markets.</p>

<p>The Yugoslavs have bowed to the decision of their
Allies. And the official champions of the too-ambitious
League of Nations&mdash;overjoyed, after various failures
and after the Silesian award, to have really accomplished
something, and something with whose merits the public
was far less familiar than with the Silesian fiasco&mdash;performed
a war-dance on the Yugoslavs. If that people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
had been as obstinate, say, as the Magyars in the case
of Burgenland, no doubt it would have come to another
Conference of Venice; and Yugoslavia would, like
Hungary, have returned from there with something
gained. But, of course, when it is an affair between
Allies one scarcely likes to behave in that stubborn and
unyielding manner which is apparently the right&mdash;at all
events, the successful&mdash;conduct for a whilom foe. If
the Yugoslavs, in simply accepting the judgment of their
Allies, acted against their own ultimate advantage, they
can, at any rate, believe that their complaisance, their
extraordinary lack of chauvinism, will be recognized.
It is true that when, on former occasions, such as during
the prolonged d'Annunzio farce at Rieka, they displayed
a similar and wonderful forbearance, they did not manage
to free themselves from this foolish charge. There
happen to be a good many people abroad who insist
that the new States are, every one of them, chauvinist;
they think it is the natural thing for a young country to
be, and especially if part of it lies in the Balkans. But
if Yugoslavia repeatedly acts in the most correct fashion
the day may come when she will be able to put a lasting
polish on to the reputation which her Allies have tarnished.</p>


<p class="section">15. THE PROSPECT</p>

<p>We may look forward to seeing the majority of this
frontier population resolved that the links between themselves
and the Yugoslavs shall not be broken. Very little
will they care for the edicts of European Ambassadors.
It would not have been surprising to hear that on the withdrawal
of the Yugoslavs to the prescribed frontier their
resourceful friends beyond it had procured from Serbia
a few volunteers to take the place of the official Serbs.
And failing this, that rough-and-ready people might
simply declare themselves to be in Yugoslavia. This time
they will be unable to persuade the Yugoslav Government
to move its excise posts more to the west. But if these
tenacious men have made up their minds to join their
brethren on the right bank of the Drin and enter Yugoslavia,
the Ambassadors' Conference would preserve more
of their dignity in accepting with a good grace that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
they are powerless to hinder.... The minority of the
border population will go raiding in Yugoslavia. If
they had been consulted they would have drawn the
frontier very much as it is. With large areas lying at
their mercy they will keep the border villages in constant
dread. And that is the other reason which should induce
the Ambassadors' Conference to cancel their unwise
decision.</p>

<p>It is better when the politicians do not come with
advice to the battlefield; and in those primitive regions,
where part of the people cannot, as yet, be restrained
from perpetual warfare, it would have been better if the
politicians had done nothing but confirm the General's
frontier. Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey gave it to the Serbs "for
the time being," and that period should last until there
is no longer any military need to hold it. "No General,
however distinguished, could possibly have any authority
whatever to give to any nation the territories of another,
such as can only be transferred and delineated by treaties
and international recognition." So says Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Goad,
or Captain Goad as he has the right to call himself. But
it is a pity that he does not appreciate the difference
between that which is temporary and that which is not.</p>

<p>Italy has been given against the Yugoslavs a purely
strategic frontier, which places under her dominion over
500,000 unwilling Slovenes, whose culture is admittedly
on a higher level than that of their Italian neighbours.
And yet the Ambassadors' Conference (in which Italy
plays a prominent part) has refused to give Yugoslavia
a strategic frontier against a much more turbulent neighbour,
which frontier, moreover, would include of alien
subjects only a small fraction of the number which Italy
has obtained. The Albanian frontier now imposed on
Yugoslavia is very much like that which the treaties of
1815 gave to France, when the passage (<i>trou&eacute;e</i>) of Couvin,
often called erroneously the trou&eacute;e of the Oise, at a
short distance from Paris, was purposely opened.
"Formerly," says Professor Jean Brunhes,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> "the sources
of the Oise belonged to France, protected, far back, by
the two enclaves of Philippeville and Marienbourg, both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>fortified by Vauban." And M. Gabriel Hanotaux<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
remarks that this opening of the trou&eacute;e of Couvin was
the reason why in 1914 France lost the battle of
Charleroi.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors' Conference has committed a grave
injustice. "Let us hope," says M. Justin Godart,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> a
French ex-Under Secretary of Hygiene, concerning whose
very misguided mission to Albania we have written
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> "let us hope," says he&mdash;in my opinion one
of the unjustest men towards Yugoslavia and Greece&mdash;"let
us hope that Yugoslavia will understand that it is
unworthy of her to contest the decision of the Ambassadors'
Conference." It has given to the Yugoslavs a frontier
that necessitates the presence of a considerable army,
and this is precisely what suits the Italians. Seeing
that in Italy there are men alive who can recall their
struggles against the Austrian oppressor, it is sad that
their own country should now be playing this very same
r&ocirc;le. The Ambassadors appear to have taken no notice
of Italy's support of the Tirana Government, but to
have been very drastic with respect to Yugoslavia's
support of the Mirditi. They have punished the Yugoslavs
by binding their hands in a district part of whose
population long for the help of those hands in gaining
some tranquillity, whereas the other part consists of
persons against whom one must defend oneself.</p>

<p>The politicians have acted as if all the border folk
were as peaceful as they doubtless are themselves. In
consequence, there will be panic and assassination till
the politicians&mdash;unable to oppose the wishes of the
majority of those who dwell in the frontier zone&mdash;proclaim
that until further notice General Franchet d'Esp&eacute;rey's
wise and prudent dispositions shall be honoured.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">That is the only method by which an Albania can
be brought slowly into existence. At this moment the
cartographers are printing the map of the Albanians'
country in accordance with the Ambassadors' decision.
They might spare themselves the trouble. The decision
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>to recognize an Albania was as premature a project as, in
Mr. Wells' opinion, is the League of Nations. A free,
united Albania has been recognized, and in a little time
the Ambassadors' Conference, perceiving that such a
thing does not exist, will be relieved to see the North and
the South taking the steps to which we have referred.
It is wonderful that the Ambassadors' Conference and the
League of Nations should imagine that a country, most
of which is in the social state of the Gallic clans in the
days of Vercingetorix, can suddenly become a modern
nation by the simple contrivance of a parliament, which,
as a matter of fact, has been the caricature of one. In
the words of Lord Halsbury, when reversing a judgment
of the Court of Appeal, I am bewildered by the absurdity
of such a suggestion. Albania is in need of organizers,
not of orators. A very competent French traveller,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
one who believes that a future is reserved for this unquenchable
people, warns the world against undue haste.
After describing the deplorable state or the non-existence
of Albanian schools, roads, ports, the monetary system
and the organization of credit, he says that it is scarcely
an exaggeration to assert that from the point of view of
economic arrangement everything has to be created.
This necessitates a Government which knows how to
administer and which has funds at its command. But
there is not the least likelihood of regular taxes being
paid to a central Government until you have security
of communication. And even then the native&mdash;except
if force is used&mdash;will not pay before he sees the benefit
which taxes produce. He who for the most part has
never given obedience save to his village chief will require
to see the local benefit. Therefore his whole outlook
must be changed; slowly from being parochial it must
become national.... There can be no greater folly than
at this stage to aim at applying modern usages, equality
of taxation, uniformity of judicial organization, and so
forth. It must be a very slow advance, says M. Jaray,
taking local traditions and the feudalism, both domestic
and collective, into account. Even if a central Government
had all the necessary qualifications, yet that would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>not cause the people to regard it with gratitude and
loyalty. It is too remote. The clans have been accustomed
to look no farther than their own chiefs. Only
in serious circumstances and against an invasion have
they united and chosen a common leader. To expect
the Albanians rapidly to throw aside their clannishness
is to prepare for oneself a disappointment. It is in the
clan that they must be made fit for something more
extensive. Let the country be recognized not as a nation,
but as a collection of clans, and let these clans, with any
outside assistance they themselves may choose, come
gradually to understand the word "Albania." ... And
what are the chances that this will come to pass? No
country is more feudal; yet only the most thoroughgoing
peasant reforms will lay a sure foundation for the State.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">The Greek Frontier</span></p>

<p>The frontier with Greece has undergone no alteration
as a result of the War. It is inconvenient in certain
details; it runs, for example, at such a very short distance
to the south of the town of Ghevgeli that the prefect has
little chance of frustrating those who actively object to
the payment of import duties. Rather a large number
of Slavs, some say 300,000, live on the Greek side of the
frontier, while a far smaller number of Greeks live in
Monastir. Both the Slavs and the Greeks have made
sundry complaints, which are more or less justified,
against the alien authority which governs them. However,
during 1919 and 1920, the two Governments resolved,
in the furtherance of their good understanding,
to raise none of these questions, neither the claims of the
derelict Slavs, who are mostly Exarchists, nor of the
Monastir Greeks, who are mostly hellenized Vlachs.
The two countries, while Venizelos was in power, were
acting on the principles of the Serbo-Greek friendship
that used to be advocated by <i>L'Hell&eacute;nisme</i>, the newspaper
which Sir Anastasius Adossides, under Venizelos the
enlightened Governor-General of Salonica, published for
several years before the first Balkan War in Paris. Yugoslavia
was to have every facility given her in Salonica,
which course would naturally be the most beneficial to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that place. And among the minor advantages of really
amicable relations would be the impossibility of such a
state of things as once prevailed at Doiran, where the
masters of the Greek and Bulgarian schools were neither
of them in a position to chastise their peccant pupils,
who could always have the last word by threatening to
transfer themselves to the rival establishment. It was,
I believe, the custom of these young scoundrels to
remain at one or other of the two schools on the understanding
that the teacher gave them a retaining fee
of so many chocolates.... One rather felt, during
1919 and 1920, that the Yugoslavs, in their willingness
to take the hand of Greece, which had so shamefully
refused to act upon its obligations in the first half of the
War, were behaving as if Venizelos would henceforward
be retained in power by his countrymen. Should the
Serbs find themselves hampered in their use of the "Free
Zone" at Salonica, a moment might arrive when they and
the Bulgars would, to their mutual advantage, make an
arrangement with regard to Salonica and her hinterland.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">The Bulgarian Frontier</span></p>

<p>There have been various modifications in the frontier
line between Serbia and Bulgaria. The Bulgars acknowledge
that in the case of the Struma salient, of the part
near Vranja and of the villages on the bank of the Timok,
it was clearly for the purpose of safeguarding the railways;
and few people would be found to say that Serbia
has been other than modest in her demands. Compare
the Italian position on the Brenner with the Yugoslav
frontier against Bulgaria and in the Baranja: against
Bulgars and Magyars the Yugoslavs only secure a sound
defensive frontier, whereas Italy obtains a capacity for
the offensive against Austria.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It is rather different
with regard to Tsaribrod, on the main line between Ni&#353;
and Sofia. So good a friend of the Yugoslavs as Dr.
Seton-Watson has deplored the cession of this small
place, since it appears likely to imperil a future friendship
between Serbia and Bulgaria. As a matter of fact the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>Yugoslav Peace Delegates requested, for strategic purposes,
a still more southerly frontier on the Dragoman
Pass, which was denied to them. But Tsaribrod, which
is dominated by the heights of Dragoman, is anyhow a
place of minor importance. It is much to be hoped that
the inhabitants will not imitate those of the Pirot <i>intelligentsia</i>
who in 1878 shook off the dust of their town
when it became Serbian and migrated to Sofia, where
they never wearied of anti-Serbian agitation. One
must do one's best not to retard the arrival of that day
when it will be almost a matter of indifference as to
whether a village is situated in Serbia or in Bulgaria.
Mr. Stanojevi&#263;, the deputy for Zaje&#269;a, which is not far
from the frontier, proposed in the Skup&#353;tina that Tsaribrod
should be left to the Bulgars in exchange for a sum
of money. This suggestion was opposed by the Radicals,
and the far-seeing Yugoslav statesmen who would gladly
have adopted it were left hoping that the Skup&#353;tina
would some day decide in its favour.... This moderation
on the part of the Serbs has been less in evidence at
Bucharest and still less at Athens. The Peace Conference
which felt itself unable to deprive its Ally of
southern Dobrudja, and unable to resist the persuasive
eloquence of M. Venizelos, does not seem to have contributed
towards a lasting Balkan peace. A reviewer in
the <i>Observer</i>, while approving of Mr. Leland Buxton's hope
of a Serb-Bulgar reconciliation, asks why this should be
effected to the exclusion and obvious detriment of Greece.
"Why not a Balkan Federation?" he asks. In view of
the very different races which inhabit the Balkans, he
might just as well ask, "Why not a European Federation?"
And the statesmen of the non-Slav Balkan
countries do not seem to have made serious efforts to
prevent the coming of a purely Slav Federation. It
remains to be seen whether, when that comes to pass,
the Greek and Roumanian people will have achieved such
statesmanship as to make an equally small effort to keep
under their control their large Slav territories.... "We
should no longer think of Thrace," said M. Venizelos in
the Greek Chamber in 1913, "for it is impossible to
include in the Greek State all those parts where Greeks
have lived; we ought to be modest and contented with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
what is most righteous and attainable; we ought not to
let ourselves be carried away by our imagination."</p>


<p class="section">(<i>d</i>) <span class="smcap">The Roumanian Frontier</span></p>

<p class="section">THE STATE OF THE ROUMANIANS IN EASTERN SERBIA</p>

<p>A new frontier between Yugoslavia and Roumania
has been drawn by the Allied Powers in the Banat.
But before we consider its merits and absurdities we must
examine the Serbo-Roumanian question in the several
departments of eastern Serbia. During 1919 one heard
a good deal, in Bucharest and in Paris, of the pitiful
Roumanians whom the Serbs had always deprived of
their own national schools and churches. It was claimed,
chiefly by a certain Dr. Athanasius Popovitch, that the
Roumanians in Serbia were longing for the day of their
redemption. On March 8, 1919, two deputations of
Roumanians from the Timok and from Macedonia, who
had lately arrived in Paris in order to plead before the
Conference, presented themselves to the Roumanian
colony at 114 Avenue des Champs-Elysees. We are told
that in consequence of their moving narrative, and on
account of the loud appeal made by them to all their
free brothers, the Roumanian colony founded, with
great enthusiasm, a national league for their delivery.
The Vice-President of the league was announced to be
Dr. Athanasius Popovici. In a pamphlet called <i>Les
Roumains de Serbie</i> (Paris, 1919), Dr. Draghicesco, a
Roumanian Senator, denounces the Serb authorities for
having obliged Dr. Athanasius, while he was a schoolboy,
to change his surname into the purely Serbian one of
Popovitch. "Not being able to endure this r&eacute;gime of
violence," we are informed, "he expatriated himself and
established himself in Roumania." But if Dr. Athanasius
felt so strongly with regard to his name when
he was a mere schoolboy, one is puzzled to understand
why, being an adult and a pamphleteer in 1919, he should
be hesitating between Popovitch, which is Serbian, and
Popovici, which is Roumanian. The Senator does not
seem to be well informed as to the early years of Dr.
Athanasius, who so far from expatriating himself as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
indignant schoolboy, remained in Serbia, where he went
through five classes of the gymnasium in Belgrade, after
which he studied theology in the same town, with a view
to succeeding his father, who was a priest at Du&#353;anovac
in eastern Serbia. Later on Athanasius performed his
military service at Zaje&#269;a, where he married&mdash;so one of
his sisters told me&mdash;one Mileva, the daughter of Yovan
Stan&#269;evi&#263;, a merchant. After his marriage he went to
Jena, in order to continue his studies, and there he became
a Doctor of Letters. It may be that while he was at
Jena he became conscious of the r&eacute;gime of violence to
which the Roumanians in Serbia are subjected; at any
rate he decided not to return to that country, where his
wife and three sisters are well satisfied to live. He
launched himself into a furious anti-Serbian propaganda in
favour of those who, in the words of Dr. Draghicesco,
are profoundly sad and full of grief at being neither
Serbian nor Roumanian, who when they meet a
Roumanian brother listen to him with pleasure and,
with their eyes full of tears, murmur: "How happy
we should be to be with you." ... When I travelled
through those parts with a view to verifying Dr.
Athanasius's assertions, I was invariably told by persons
of Roumanian origin that they had no complaint whatever
against the Serbs, and that the last thing they desired
was to be politically united to the Roumanians of the
kingdom. Dr. Athanasius might reply that his wretched
compatriots were impelled by fear to give such answers.
But what do they fear?&mdash;one finds that among these
people are deputies, priests, army officers and so forth.
"To-day," says Dr. Athanasius, "all the peoples who
are reduced to slavery by other people secure the right
to return to their fatherland." The Roumanians of
Serbia would have to be a good deal more miserable before
wishing to have anything to do with Roumania. Milan
Soldatovi&#263;, ex-mayor of the great mining village of Bor
and himself of Roumanian origin, said that he had never
heard of any one who went to work in Roumania. No
doubt the present generation of Roumanian landowners
deeply deplore the misdeeds of their ancestors, who drove
the ancestors of these peasants away from Roumania.
"The peasant hovels were merely dark burrows, called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
<i>bordei</i>, holes dug in the ground and roofed with poles
covered with earth, rising scarcely above the level of the
plain.... The interior was indescribable. Neither furniture
nor utensils, with the exception of the boards
which served as beds or seats and the pot for cooking
the <i>mamaliga</i>"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>&mdash;his sole food, a paste consisting of
maize meal cooked in water. And one cannot be
astonished if the Roumanians in Serbia are chary of
believing that their native land has changed for the
better. "If," said a Roumanian peasant before an Agricultural
Commission in 1848, "if the boyar could have
laid hands upon the sun, he would have seized it and
sold God's light and warmth to the peasant for money."
Even in 1919 the peasant still had much reason to be
dissatisfied, for where the owner parted with his land it
was usually&mdash;no doubt as a stage in the transaction&mdash;made
over to the village as a whole. And if the boyar
no longer has the monopoly of the sale of alcohol, if he
has so far improved that Vallachia is not now losing its
inhabitants as it was after the Regulations of 1831, when
we read that "in vain the rivers are assiduously watched,
as if in a state of siege; the emigrants cross at the places
which are clear of troops. Emigration is especially rife
in winter, when the frozen Danube presents an ever-open
bridge," yet among the Roumanians of Serbia it
has been handed down from father to son what happened
in the reign of Prince Milo&#353;. To take one case out of
many such that are preserved in the National Archives
at Belgrade, a dispatch was sent on February 11, 1831,
by Vule Gligorievi&#263;, his representative in those parts,
to Prince Milo&#353;, who was at Kragujevac, enclosing a
supplication from the priests and other inhabitants of the
large Roumanian island called Veliko Ostrvo, in the
middle of the Danube, praying that they might be allowed
to cross to Serbia. "We are in great misery," they wrote,
"and have boyars who are very bad, and we cannot bear
the misery in which we find ourselves, and in the greatest
grief we beg your Highness to let us come to Serbia with
our wives and children." The Prince had a special
sympathy for Roumania and was therefore most reluctant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>to intervene in her internal affairs. He adopted
a very cautious attitude in this matter, but when Gligorievi&#263;
sent him petition after petition he was finally
so touched by the recital of their woes that he permitted
them to cross the river; and one night, with the help
of the Serbian authorities, the whole island crossed over,
to wit 57 families, with 186 oxen, 70 horses, 694 sheep
and 87 pigs. Milo&#353; made them a free grant of land for
the building of a village, together with a vast stretch
of territory for pasture and stock-raising; at his own
expense he built them a church and extended to them all
the liberties and advantages enjoyed in Serbia by the
Serbs themselves. As a token of their gratitude these
Roumanian emigrants called their village Mihailovac, after
the name of Michael, the Prince's son. This village is
the birthplace of our friend Dr. Athanasius, whose
sentiments appear to have placed him in a minority of
one. When his pamphlet came into the hands of Jorge
Korni&#263;, the mayor of Mihailovac and a Roumanian by
origin, he brought it to the prefect at Negotin saying that
he wished to have nothing to do "with any devil's work."</p>

<p>As Dr. Athanasius and his chauvinist friends give a
pretty lurid picture of the Roumanian villager who lives
in Serbia, I visited a few places where the population
is wholly Roumanian or Serbo-Roumanian. The 766
inhabitants of Ostralje are all of Roumanian descent,
the mayor being one Velimir Mi&#353;kovi&#263;, a sergeant of
reserves who has been transferred from the army in
order to carry on his municipal duties. All the inhabitants
speak Serbian and Vlach. "We were always
Serbs," they said. "Nobody told us that we had
migrated to this place." And amongst those who
assembled to talk with us at the schoolmaster's house
there was only one who, in the Roumanian fashion, had
drawn his socks over his white trousers. The 2221 inhabitants
of the village of Grljan are about two-thirds of
Roumanian and one-third of Serbian origin. Formerly
they each had their own part of the village, but now they
are intermingled both in the village and in the cemetery.
They intermarry freely; thus Jon Jonovi&#263;, the most
notable person, who used to represent this district in the
Skup&#353;tina at Belgrade, has three Serbian daughters-in-law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
He was a member of the Opposition Liberal
group of Ribarac. "And did you ever request that your
fellow-countrymen should have their own Roumanian
schools and churches?" we asked. This is one of the
chief demands of Dr. Athanasius. "I was not the only
Roumanian who was a deputy," said the old man of the
furrowed face. "There was Novak Dobromirovi&#263; of Zlot;
there was Jorge Stankovi&#263;, for instance; but we never
thought of asking for such a thing, since we had no need
for it." The son of the wealthy Sima Yovanovi&#263; at Bor
observed with a smile that the first business of Roumanian
schools would have to be the teaching of Roumanian.
"My father sent me to be educated at Vienna," he said,
"and when I met some boys from Bucharest we found
that our language was so different that we had to talk
to one another in German. And now when a commercial
traveller comes here from Roumania I have to talk
German to him, as I would otherwise have to converse
with my hands and feet." The French mining officials, by
the way, at Bor testified that they had never heard of any
tension between men of Serbian and those of Roumanian
origin; the Roumanians, who prefer agricultural work, are
more attracted to the mines in winter, when over 40 per
cent. of the 1500 employ&eacute;s are Roumanians.</p>

<p>Dr. Athanasius and his friends are agitated, as one
would imagine, when they discuss with you the numbers
of their countrymen. In <i>Le Temps</i> of April 22, 1919,
they declared that they could produce 500,000, for they
realized that their previous claim of between 250,000 and
350,000 was not large enough to give the Roumanians in
Serbia the benefit of the principle of nationality. But
even this more modest figure will be found, on examination,
to be exaggerated. In the four north-eastern
counties of Serbia there were 159,510 Roumanians in
1895; 120,628 in 1900, and in 1910 a little over 90,000.
This diminution, say the chauvinists, is due to a falsifying
of statistics, for those, they say, who have attended
a Serbian school are inscribed as Serbs. The truth is
that everyone is entered according to his mother-tongue.
And history knows countless instances of a gradual
decrease in the case of people placed in foreign surroundings
and exposed to foreign influences. Like the Illyrians who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
people Dalmatia, the Thracians of ancient Dacia and the
Serbs who emigrated to Russia in the seventeenth century,
the Roumanians of Serbia are undergoing this process
and are inevitably becoming Serbicized. Frequently we
noticed that men possessing no Serbian blood did not care
to admit their Roumanian origin, which, however, is no
secret to their neighbours in spite of the Serbian termination
"i&#263;" that, in the course of years, has been affixed
to their names. An allusion to their origin is clearly
regarded as lacking in delicacy. "Well, my ancestors
were Roumanian," is often as much as they will admit.
And when some enterprising agitators came over from
Roumania to the department of Po&#382;arevac in 1919, the
Roumanians of those parts gave up to the authorities all
those who did not manage to escape. For ten years
Lieut.-Colonel Gjorge Markovi&#263; commanded the 9th
Regiment, which is chiefly formed of Roumanians from
that region. They used to tell him that they wanted
to have nothing to do with the Roumanian boyars.
"Here we are boyars ourselves," they said. All of them
speak Serbian, many of them write it; and on winter
evenings they have for years received instruction in
reading, writing, arithmetic and singing, which compares
favourably with Roumania's army, in which, as I was
told at Bucharest, the plan of starting any education
had to be postponed in consequence of the outbreak of
the Great War. Together with the unwillingness of
these people to acknowledge their origin, one observes
a general vagueness as to the home of their forefathers.
Apparently these came over from southern Hungary,
whence the name Ungureani,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> or from Tara Rumaneasca,
<i>i.e.</i> the Roumanian land, whence the name Tarani.
Others again are descended from Roumanized Serbs
who came from Kossovo and other Serb regions of the
south, lived in the Banat and Transylvania among the
Roumanian villages, acquired the Roumanian language
and then crossed over to Serbia. These three classes have
all come to Serbia in recent times. Any attempt on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>part of Dr. Athanasius and his friends to drag in the
Romans can be answered by the undoubted fact that the
ancient Roman colonists had completely disappeared
from Serbia as far back as the fifteenth century, leaving
no trace at all, and there is no connection between them
and the present Roumanian population of Serbia. No
memories remain of the old Roman colonists, save certain
place-names which, as Professor Georgevi&#263; remarks,
strike one as surprising in the midst of a purely Serbian
population. It is interesting to note that these ancient
Roman place-names are very rare in the regions inhabited
to-day by men of Roumanian origin.</p>

<p>It would not have been worth whole devoting so much
space to the activities of Dr. Athanasius and his adherents
but for the fact that European public opinion, which has
concerned itself extremely little with the Roumanians
of Serbia, might possibly imagine that their advocate
deserves to be taken seriously.</p>


<p class="section">2. THE BANAT</p>

<p>Anyone who looks at an ethnological map of the Banat
will recognize how difficult it is to partition that province
among two or three claimants. No matter by whom
the map is painted, it must have the appearance of mosaic,
with few solid masses of colour. This fact was quickly
used by the Roumanians, who argued that as the Banat
had never been divided, neither politically nor economically,
it should still remain one whole&mdash;of course under
the Roumanian flag. The Magyars haughtily pointed
out that as the Banat had never been divided, but had
for a thousand years lived under the crown of St. Stephen,
it should still remain one whole&mdash;of course under the
Hungarian flag. The Roumanians contended that the
indivisibility of the Banat was designed by Nature,
since the mountainous eastern part could not exist if
separated from the fertile west. The Magyars asserted
that it was altogether wrong to think of the radical
remodelling and complete dismemberment of a territory
which Nature had predestined to be one. The Yugoslavs
agreed with both parties that it was not easy to draw a
satisfactory frontier, but they asked that, as far as possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the predominantly Roumanian parts should be joined
to Roumania, the Slav populations to them and the
Magyars to Hungary. As a matter of fact the Paris
Conference did attempt to make an ethnical division,
between these three States, of the Banat. Roumania
tried to demonstrate the impossibility of this by turning
off the water in the Bega Canal when the Serbs evacuated
Teme&#353;var and were taking their heavily-laden barges
from that town. There will have to be a central, international
organization to control the network of waterways.
As soon as the Paris Conference had decided on
this division it was told by the Magyars, the Roumanians
and the Yugoslavs that all the numerous Germans of the
Banat wished to belong to Hungary, to Roumania and
to Yugoslavia. A great many of the Germans were
indifferent, so long as they could peaceably carry on their
prosperous agricultural operations. Not much political
solidarity is apparent among the Germans of the Banat,
and seeing that both Yugoslavia and Roumania, now
the principal possessors of this land, have elsewhere
within their boundaries large German populations, their
respective Banat Germans will be able to ally themselves
with these in the Parliaments of Belgrade and Bucharest.
The Banat Germans who are discontented with the Paris
decisions are firstly those, among the aristocratic and
commercial classes, who were accustomed to enjoy under
the Magyars a favoured position, and secondly those who,
with more or less justification, say that Roumania has
yet to show that she will treat her subject minorities in
a truly liberal fashion. It is for this reason that the
Germans of Ver&#353;ac and Bela Crkva&mdash;in which towns
they are about as numerous as the total of Yugoslavs,
Roumanians and Magyars&mdash;would give a majority in
favour of Yugoslavia if they were asked to vote as to
Yugoslav or Roumanian citizenship. <i>Adeverul</i>, which
is one of the least chauvinist of Bucharest newspapers,
claimed for Roumania at least the railway line: Teme&#353;var,
Ver&#353;ac, Bela Crkva, Bazias&mdash;an argument thought to be
conclusive being that the two central towns are neither
Roumanian nor Serbian but German. This railway line
was, as a matter of fact, bestowed by the Peace Conference
on Roumania, and it required some strenuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
work before this decision was modified. The French were
suspected in Yugoslavia of leaning unduly towards the
Roumanians, through sympathy with the Latin strain
in their blood; yet it was the French who were for giving
to Yugoslavia not only Bazias but the villages on the
Danube down to Old Moldava, seeing that in those districts
the Slavs are certainly in a majority. The Roumanian
case was not assisted by Professor Candrea's ethnographical
map, for in the debated country around Bela
Crkva that gentleman, who told me that he had omitted
every place whose population was less than a hundred,
has unfortunately forgotten to include Zlatica, a village
of 1346 inhabitants, which was founded at the gate of a
monastery six hundred and sixty years ago. The population
is according to the Hungarian census of 1910, at
which time all the 1346 were Serbs, with the exception of
220 Czechs and a few gipsies. Professor Candrea has
forgotten Sokolavac, a nourishing place about two hundred
and fifty years old with 1800 inhabitants and practically
all of them Serbs, as the Transylvanian Minister of Education
admitted. Palanka with 1400 inhabitants, most
Serbs; Fabian with about 1000, mostly Czechs; Duplaja
with 1204, all Serbs but for 10 Slovenes; Crvena Crkva
with 1108 (1048 Serbs, 34 Slovaks, 17 Germans and 9
Magyars), are every one omitted. Lescovac, with 977
inhabitants, the Professor marks as Roumanian. When I
was at this picturesquely situated place I was received
in the mayor's office by half a dozen burly peasants in
the Serbian national costume who asserted that, with
the exception of the tailor (a Roumanian emigrant) and
one or two other persons, the village was wholly Serb.
But Lescovac was then within the Serbian sphere of
occupation, and possibly if I were to go there now I would
be told an appropriate story by other, or the same,
peasants in Roumanian attire. One must try to find
some surer indication of nationality, and Professor Candrea
told me that twenty-five years ago he took down a pure
Roumanian text at that place, where the Roumanian
language is the most antique in the Banat. On the
other hand, the village must have contained many Serbs,
for when the late notary, a powerful Magyar with
Roumanian sympathies, prevented the school being conducted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
as it always had been, in the Serbian language,
and installed a teacher&mdash;he stayed for eight years&mdash;who
could only speak Magyar and Roumanian, the villagers
at their own expense procured a Serbian school-mistress.
She was expelled by the notary.... This illustrates
the difficulties which the Peace Conference, in its desire
to trace an ethnical frontier, was confronted with. And
there was no map which did not make it obvious that
Serbian villages would have to remain to the east and
Roumanian villages to the west of any possible line.
They did right, I think, to revise their decision as to the
towns of Ver&#353;ac and Bela Crkva, for there the Yugoslavs
and their German friends have a large and unquestioned
preponderance. Bazias, with about three miles of the
railway, was given to Roumania so that she should have,
for the exportation of her wood and iron-ore, the only
harbour in that region of the Danube which is capable of
development. However, with no railway over Roumanian
soil from Bazias to the mines, this port is perfectly useless,
and it is to be hoped that Roumania will give it up, for
compensation elsewhere, to the Yugoslavs. The latter
would otherwise be compelled to build three or four
miles of railway, from Bela Crkva to Palanka, which,
unless a great deal of money be spent on it, will always
be one of the worst ports on the river. With a little more
difficulty than to Bazias the Roumanians could construct
a railway to Moldava, which also is a very good port;
and in return for this accommodation, whereby the
wines of Bela Crkva could be shipped from Bazias, their
natural port, the Yugoslavs would be ready to make over
to Roumania one or two villages whose population far
exceeds that of little Bazias. We may also hope that
facilities will be given by the two Governments for the
emigration of those who wish to cross the new frontier
line. Formerly the people of the Banat had no strenuous
objections to being moved, lock, stock and barrel, from
one district to another and without the inducement of
coming under the rule of their own race. Thus the
village of Zsam, to the north of Ver&#353;ac, was, like many
others, very sparsely inhabited when the Turks withdrew
in 1716; some villages had only three or four occupied
houses. So the Government in 1722 collected into one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
village the people of several others, and in this way Zsam,
which had hitherto been Slav, became Roumanian, the
Serbs being established in the neighbouring Sredi&#353;te.
In 1809 the Roumanians were transplanted from Zsam
to Petrovasela, between Ver&#353;ac and Pan&#269;evo, where
they entered the Pan&#269;evo Frontier Regiment; their
place at Zsam was taken by Germans, who, being more
industrious, were preferred by the landowners.</p>

<p>Some of the delineators of this frontier&mdash;French and
British&mdash;have told me that they were guided throughout
by the ethnical principle. But various unfortunate
exceptions seem to have been made: for instance, at
Ko&#269;a it runs through a certain house in such a way that
the lavatory alone is in Roumania; and in another village
there lives a man who, since his stables are situated in
Roumania, would have had his horses requisitioned if
he had not been able to bring them into the other part of
the house. Another village has its cemetery in Roumania,
so that the Yugoslavs carry their dead friends over during
the night. Perhaps the Entente officials, perceiving that
their ambitious resolution to divide the country on
ethnic principles was not feasible&mdash;there would always
be alien islands to the right and to the left of any line&mdash;perhaps
they in despair drew an arbitrary line upon a
map and hoped the poor inhabitants would make the
best of it. But this was rendered more difficult by the
Yugoslav and Roumanian authorities, for the people who
desire to cross the line are put to endless trouble. Apart
from the expense, it usually involves a delay of three
weeks before permission can be obtained, so that the
frontier is rarely traversed save by smugglers and by
those who, like the afore-mentioned man of Ko&#269;a, have
been driven into chronic lawlessness.</p>

<p>The first line agreed upon after the War, which
temporarily bestowed the eastern county on Roumania,
the western on Yugoslavia and the chief parts of the
central (or Teme&#353;var) county also on Yugoslavia&mdash;with
French co-operation&mdash;did not find favour in Paris;
whether or not this decision was influenced by the frequent
journeys of the Queen of Roumania and her fascinating
daughters to that town I do not know. At all
events another boundary was made which included the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
large town of Teme&#353;var and all the northern part of that
county in Roumania. It is true that there are Roumanian
villages in the neighbourhood of this German-Magyar-Jewish
town, which is by far the largest place in the
Banat. And the Roumanians, who have already annexed
enormous Magyar and German populations in Transylvania,
do not boggle at another 80,000 foreigners.
One could, however, find very few Yugoslavs who want
Teme&#353;var to be restored to them; they know that they
and the Roumanians, whatever (as regards themselves)
may have been the case in other days, form, each of them,
only about one-thirtieth of the total population. But
they are sorry that the Allies asked them to share in
occupying the town, because the local Serbs, who are
interested in politics, were so enthusiastic, that on the
arrival of the Roumanians they were forced to leave
their businesses and go to live in Yugoslavia. Since
neither Serbs nor Roumanians have any ethnical claim
to the town one would suppose that, as the spoil had
fallen to Roumania, the Entente would have endeavoured
to give the Yugoslavs some compensation: what they
did was to take away from them a good deal of that
which they had&mdash;a considerable slice of their western
county&mdash;which also was presented to the Roumanians.
Again, the delineators excused themselves by invoking
their ethnical motives, but as a matter of fact in that
part of Torontal the people are predominantly German
and they should have been allotted to Yugoslavia, not
merely because the Teme&#353;var Germans were given to
Roumania but on account of their economic existence,
which certainly in the case of the departments of
Nagyszentmikl&oacute;s, Perj&aacute;mos and Csene (to retain the
Magyar spelling) is bound up with Zsombolya, their
market-town, and Kikinda. According to the census
that was taken in 1919, the population of these three
departments now allotted to Roumania consisted of
41,109 Germans, 13,638 Yugoslavs and 19,270 Roumanians.
Further, to the south-east of Torontal, in the
departments of P&aacute;rd&aacute;ny, M&oacute;dos and B&aacute;nlak, there is not
so intimate a connection with the market-town; here
the population consists of 12,209 Germans, 11,102 Yugoslavs
and 8808 Roumanians. But there seems to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
little reason why the whole of Torontal, following the
wishes of the majority of its inhabitants, should not be
given to Yugoslavia; and this would also reduce to a
minimum the inconveniences produced by any frontier.
For many long years there has been a county frontier
between Torontal and Teme&#353;var, each of which was
under an official who looked direct to Buda-Pest. The
adoption of this ancient county frontier as that of the
two countries would put an end to the present absurd
and unjust, not to say dangerous, situation. It should,
therefore, be brought about as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A similar rectification is needed in the country to
the north and north-west. The three German villages
of Komlo&#353;, Mariafeld and St. Miklo&#353; have their fields
near Velika Kikinda, in Yugoslavia, whereas they are
themselves in Roumania. To bring home his maize
from the land a farmer was obliged to pay, at the most
favourable rate, up to 200 crowns a pound. Considering
that this part of the country is an absolute plain with no
river flowing through it, one would suppose that a rectification
could easily be made. If these Germans had
been consulted they would naturally have opted for
Yugoslavia. The Peace Conference officials might, also
have studied Velika Kikinda, a place with a very creditable
past, which&mdash;as I was told by a Serb professional
man of that town&mdash;will be completely ruined if she loses
the custom of these German villages and has to depend
upon the Serb peasants who make one embroidered suit
and one pair of sandals last them for ten years.... It
will be necessary for the Yugoslav authorities in the
Banat not only to endeavour to raise their countrymen's
standard of living but also in the southerly districts,
where the standard is higher, to persuade them not to
persist in limiting their families. The Serbs in the old
kingdom have been one of the most prolific of European
races&mdash;they would otherwise have been incapable of
carrying on their twenty-six years of war during this last
century&mdash;but in the south and south-east of the Banat,
perhaps through mere love of comfort, perhaps through
Magyar oppression, there has been a marked tendency
not to increase. The Magyars and Germans have had
normal families, the Roumanians have increased by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
assimilation (a woman marrying into a Serbian family
will often cause them all to speak her easier language).
The Serbs, however, will in their part of the Banat absorb
the others if they show political understanding and a
liberal spirit. "We will give the Germans," said Pribi&#269;evi&#263;
to one of them at Ver&#353;ac&mdash;"we will give them everything
up to a university."</p>

<p>The north-west corner of the Banat, which has a
considerable Magyar population, has been ascribed to
Hungary. Opposite the apex of this triangular tract of
country lies Szeged, the second city of Hungary (118,328
inhabitants, of whom 113,380 are Magyars) and the chief
centre of the grain trade of the rich southern plains.
As was pointed out in <i>The New Europe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Szeged, which
lies in flat country, would be even more defenceless than
Belgrade if the lands on the other side of the river were
under alien rule. If one draws a strategical frontier the
nationality of the people is, of course, disregarded; it is,
therefore, beside the point to mention that there seem
to be far more Serbs in the angle opposite Szeged than
there were Magyars in the lands opposite Belgrade.
The Entente has simply made up its mind to be generous
to Szeged, and let us hope that we have not left this
region to Hungary on account of the activities of the
extremely intelligent Baroness Gerliczy&mdash;a Roumanian
lady married to a Magyar&mdash;who owns a large estate there
and was much in Paris during the critical period.</p>

<p>The other imperfections in the Paris arrangements,
whether with regard to villages or fields, are not incapable
of amendment. One presumes that the Roumanians,
who have no lack of other international problems, will
be wise enough to discard certain dicta of their Liberal
party and of Bratiano, its self-satisfied leader, to whom
all subjects seem great if they have passed through his
mind. One particular dictum which the Roumanians
ought to cast aside is that which insists upon the indivisibility
of the Banat. Another Roumanian statesman,
Take Jonescu, was more sagacious when he, during the
War, drew up a memorandum whose object was that
Greece, Serbia, Roumania and the Czecho-Slovak Governments
should work in harmony. This idea of presenting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>a single diplomatic front was to the liking of Mr. Balfour,
who observed to M. Jonescu that it would be better for
these States and better for Europe. As regards an understanding
between Roumania and Serbia in the Banat:
"I," said Pa&#353;i&#263;&mdash;"I speak for Serbia. Can you speak
for Roumania?"</p>

<p>And Jonescu unfortunately had to shake his head.</p>

<p>In the fatuous policy of crying for the whole Banat&mdash;they
even require the little island in the Danube between
Semlin and Belgrade&mdash;Bratiano is assisted by the aged
Marghiloman, who is the chief of a branch of the Conservative
party. But the relations between these two
do not seem destined to be cordial, since Bratiano is
married to Marghiloman's divorced wife.</p>

<p>May the Roumanian people become reconciled to
Yugoslavia's righteous possession of part of the Banat.
It would be a pity if these two neighbours were to live
together on such terms as, in the eastern county of the
Banat, Caras-Severin, do the Bufani and the other
Roumanians. The Bufani came from Roumania some
hundred and fifty or two hundred years ago, on account of
the taxes which they found intolerable; and they have
not been able to arrive at amicable relations with those
countrymen of theirs who are the descendants of earlier
emigrants. Very seldom do the Bufani and the others
intermarry. These Bufani, so say the others, are like ivy.
"They called out," complain the others, "they called
out: 'Little brother, be good to us!' and then they
strangled us." The Bufani, who are easily recognizable
by their dialect, frequent the same church and have one
priest with the others, but they have a separate cemetery.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>e</i>) <span class="smcap">The Hungarian Frontier</span></p>

<p>North of the town of Subotica the frontier between
Yugoslavia and Hungary is almost a natural one, as it
runs over vast hills of shifting sand which are still partly
in motion. Neither on foot nor on horseback, still less
with loaded carts, is it possible to travel through these
hills. But to the east and to the west of them the frontier
is no better than that which separates Yugoslavia from
Roumania, and when it came to the delimitation the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Magyars thought it would be preferable if this work
were done with their assistance. Otherwise, so they
urged, there would be no check upon the wicked intolerance
of their neighbours. It is true that they themselves
had in the past been in favour of centralization, but
against this one must remember that the "subject
nationalities" were inferior beings. The Yugoslavs, the
Roumanians and the Slovaks could not claim a glorious
descent from Attila, of whom a fresco decorates the
House of Parliament at Buda-Pest, and thus the Magyars
had always thought it seemly that, by various devices,
a limit should be put to the number of Yugoslav,
Roumanian and Slovak deputies. Count Apponyi and
his colleagues told the Peace Conference very frankly
at the beginning of 1920 that it really ought to take their
word for it, and not persist in looking on the Yugoslavs,
etc., as if they were as good as any Magyar. Surely it
was obvious that Yugoslavia, Greater Roumania and
Czecho-Slovakia would be "artificial and improvised
creations, devoid of the traditions of political solidarity
and incapable of producing any." But if the Supreme
Council was resolved to allow certain Magyar territories
to join themselves, if they desired, to these ephemeral
States it would be necessary to ascertain by means of a
plebiscite what were the real wishes of the people in these
territories; and Count Apponyi was kind enough to tell
the Council very definitely how this plebiscite should be
conducted. The principal Allies were to arrange, in
accordance with the Magyar Government, as to the
districts in which a plebiscite was to be held, and the
secret voting was to be controlled by neutral commissions
and delegates of the interested Governments. This may
sound rather rash on the part of the Magyars, since a
plebiscite, no matter how it was arranged and controlled,
would <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'persumably'">presumably</ins> detach a good many jewels from the
crown of St. Stephen, and it was not astonishing that
Count Apponyi and his friends proposed that the Magyars
should be safeguarded by further Commissions which,
if requisite, would override the results of the voting.
These results would indeed, as between the Magyars and
the Yugoslavs, have given our Allies a larger dominion
than they have actually obtained. The triangle south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of Szeged, to which we have alluded, would certainly,
if there had been a plebiscite, have gone to Yugoslavia.
In Baranja the Yugoslavs have claimed that
the census of 1910, which indicated 36,000 Serbo-Croats,
should have given them 70,000; but this does not take
account of the large number of &#352;okci&mdash;Slavs whose
ancestors were forcibly converted to Catholicism and
who came to consider themselves as one with the Catholic
Magyars. This widespread phenomenon of race being
superseded by religion may be noticed, for example, at
Janjevo in the district of Old Serbia; it is inhabited
by the descendants of Dubrovnik colonists who, being
Catholic, have come to look upon themselves as Albanians.
In Hungary the dominant Magyar minority was wont
to clasp the subject races to its bosom, not with bonds
of love but of religion. Thus in 1914 at Marmoros-Sziget
they charged 100 persons with high treason,
because it was their wish to leave the Uniate Church, in
communion with Rome, and return to the Orthodox
faith. The same charge would have been preferred
against certain Ruthenians who were just as unwilling
to be members of the Uniate Church; but in the case of
these humble, backward people the conversion had been
effected by their priests, who would thereby procure for
themselves a better situation, and the Ruthenians, who
had not been told of this occurrence, were under the
impression that they were still Orthodox. Professor
Cviji&#263; believes that, with the help of the Catholic religion,
no less than 113,000 Serbo-Croats have in Baranja been
lost by their Yugoslav brethren.... When the Yugoslavs
were asked by the Supreme Council to evacuate most of
Baranja they did so. A republic, under the presidency
of one Dobrovi&#263;, a well-known cubist painter, a native
of those parts, was formed by Yugoslavs and the Magyars
whose freedom had been safeguarded under their rule.
But as this republic was not assisted by the Yugoslav
Government it only lasted for a week.</p>

<p>Farther to the west is the Prekomurdje, that interesting
Slovene district which extends for about 25 miles
along the Mur. The rich plain that adjoins the river
is mostly in the possession of large landowners, while
the hilly country to the north sustains a scattered and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
poor population of Calvinists. There are in the whole
Prekomurdje some 120,000 Yugoslavs, who are descendants
of the old Pannonian Slovenes. This healthy,
honest people has indeed eighteen Catholic and eight
Protestant priests, but is otherwise almost destitute of
an <i>intelligentsia</i>. They speak nothing but Slovene, and
yet the Magyars had for ten years previous to the War
been so imperialist that only Magyar schools were tolerated.
Thus it happened that the children, like so many
others in the Magyar schools, were at a loss to understand
what they were writing, and if their teacher chanced
to learn the Slovene language he was there and then
transferred to Transylvania or the Slovak country or some
other province where he had to teach his pupils in the
Magyar which they did not know. He was supposed to
make the children feel the vast superiority of all things
Magyar, so that they should be ashamed to walk with
their own fathers in the streets and speak another tongue.
We are told occasionally in the <i>Morning Post</i> that consideration
should be shown to the Magyars since they are
a proud people, but would they not merit more consideration
if they were a grateful people, grateful that the rest
of Europe, overlooking their Mongolian origin, has
accepted them as equals? The Magyars were so
thoroughly persuaded of their own pre-eminence that
when the devotees of Haydn founded in his honour a
society at Eisenstadt, where he had worked, it was
allowed on the condition that the statutes and the name
of the society and so forth should be in the Magyar
language, although Haydn was a German. Evidently
the poor Slovenes of the Prekomurdje would be swamped
unless they showed exceptional vigour. And when they
managed to survive until after the War the Americans
in Paris were for handing them to Hungary on the ground
that the frontier would, if it included them in Yugoslavia,
be an awkward one. Such is also the opinion of Mr.
A.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;E. Taylor in his <i>The Future of the Southern Slavs</i>;
this author advocates that Yugoslavia should be bounded
by the Mur, albeit in another part of the same book he
says that "a small river is not usually a good frontier,
except on the map"; and the Mur is so narrow that
when Dr. Gaston Reverdy, of the French army, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
arrived at Ljutomir we found that a crowd of these men
and boys had waded across the stream in order to lay
their cause before the doctor, who represented the Entente
in that region. The Bol&#353;evik Magyars were just then
threatening to set all Prekomurdje on fire, and the pleasant-looking,
rather shy men who stood in rows before us
begged the doctor to procure them weapons&mdash;they would
be able to defend themselves. It is satisfactory to know
that most of this portion of the Yugoslav lands has, after
all, not been lost to the mother country.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>f</i>) <span class="smcap">The Austrian Frontier</span></p>

<p>A considerable part of the frontier between Yugoslavia
and Austria has been determined by a plebiscite which
was held, under French, British and Italian control, in
the autumn of 1920. The Slovenes during the previous
year had pointed out that while they could no longer
claim so wide a territory now that Austria had been
drawn towards the Adriatic, yet the rural population
of Carinthia had remained Slovene, thanks to the notable
qualities of that people. The German-Austrians, on the
other hand, maintained that country districts are the
appanages of a town, so that the wishes of a rural population
are of secondary importance. While these questions
were being debated in 1919 by the two interested parties&mdash;and
debated, very often, by their rifles&mdash;the Italians
intervened. Sonnino's paper, the <i>Epoca</i>, made a great
outcry over Klagenfurt (Celovec) which, if given to the
Yugoslavs, would be an insurmountable barrier, it said,
to the trade between Triest and Vienna, although it was
clear that the railway connection through Tarvis remained
in the hands of the Italians. (There is not a single
Italian civilian in Tarvis&mdash;but no matter.) Meanwhile
the French Press noted that the Italians&mdash;presumably
not as traders but as benefactors&mdash;were seeing to it that
the Austrians did not run short of arms and munitions.
For many months a large area was in a condition of
uncertainty and turmoil, till at last the Peace Conference
ordered a plebiscite.</p>

<p>Two zones in Carinthia&mdash;"A" to the south-east,
with its centre at Velikovec (V&ouml;lkermarkt), and "B" to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the north-west, with its centre at Klagenfurt (Celovec)&mdash;were
mapped out, and it was agreed that if the voting
in "A," the larger zone, were favourable to Austria,
then the other zone would automatically fall to that
country. For several months before the voting day this
area&mdash;a region of beautiful and prosperous valleys watered
by the broad Drave and surrounded by magnificent
mountain ranges&mdash;for several months this area was the
scene of great activity. German-Austrians and Yugoslavs
no longer, as in 1919, attacked each other with the
implements of war, but with pamphlet, broadsheet,
with eloquence and bribery. Austrian and Yugoslav
officials took up their headquarters at various places and
saw to it that every voter should be posted as to the moral
and material advantage he would reap by helping to
make the land Austrian or Yugoslav, as the case might
be. All those were entitled to vote who, being twenty
years of age in January 1919, had their habitual residence
in this area; or, if not born in the district, had belonged
to it or had their habitual residence there from, at least,
January 1, 1912. The larger zone "A" was left under
Yugoslav administration, while zone "B" was under
the Austrian authorities; and the Inter-Allied officials
exercised a very close supervision in order, for example,
to protect the partisans of either side from undue repression
at the hands of their opponents. Neither the
Austrians nor the Yugoslavs lost any opportunities for
saying in public that the Inter-Allied Commissions were
honestly making every effort to be impartial. It was,
however, unfortunate that Italy should have sent as her
chief representative Prince Livio Borghese, who may
have been as impartial as his colleagues, but whose
reputation, whether merited or otherwise, could scarcely
commend itself to the Yugoslavs. They believed that
his activities in Buda-Pest, under the Bol&#353;evik r&eacute;gime,
and afterwards in Vienna, had been very hostile to themselves.
Each of the three allied commissioners had a staff
of some fifty or sixty officials, whose upkeep and expenses
were paid by the two interested countries.</p>

<p>If an average person had been asked to foretell the
result of the plebiscite I suppose he would have said
that in zone "A" the Yugoslavs and in zone "B" the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Austrians would be successful. We have seen how the
Slovene renaissance of the nineteenth century was met
by the central authorities in Vienna (particularly after
the German victory of 1871), and how the local functionaries
assisted them. They argued that Austria with her
miscellaneous races could only survive if one of them
was supreme. Therefore they looked askance on every
one who regarded himself as a Slovene; if he rose to be
an official it had to be in another part of the Monarchy,
while for the maintenance of Austria (oblivious to the
argument that Austria was a perfectly unnatural affair)
they favoured all those who announced themselves to be
on the side of the predominant race. From 1903 onwards
the Slovene language was barred from the courts
of Carinthia, and if a person did not understand the
language of the German magistrates he had to use an
interpreter. The land was invaded by the German
<i>intelligentsia</i>: professors, masters in primary and
secondary schools, doctors, lawyers and so forth, excise
officials and railway officials&mdash;in 1912 Carinthia possessed
about 5000 of these and only 1&frac12; per cent. were
Slovenes. Those among the Slovenes who were capable
of serving in such positions were dispatched to Carniola,
Dalmatia or preferably to the German-speaking lands of
the Empire. A provincial agricultural authority was set
up in 1910 which was recognized by the State and which
enjoyed a monopoly. Its object was to aid the progress
of agriculture by establishing and supporting agricultural
schools, sending experts to the farmer, distributing
subsidies for the purchase of machinery, artificial manure
and so on. The council consisted of twenty-one members,
of whom only one was a Slovene; the subsidies were given
to those who were recognized as Germanophils, while
requests were not permitted in the Slovene tongue. As
for the electoral districts, they were so manipulated that
one deputy represented 120,000 Slovenes and another
represented 27,000 Germans. Constituencies in which
there was a German majority were allowed to send
two members, while the others only sent one. The German
railway employees worked so thoroughly for pan-Germanism
that various Slovenes were arrested&mdash;among
them the mayor of a large village who wanted to travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
from Celovec&mdash;for asking in the Slovene language for a
ticket. With regard to schools, there were throughout
Carinthia in 1860 some 28 Slovene and 56 Slovene-German
foundations, whereas in 1914 there were 2
Slovene, 30 German and 84 mixed schools, where the two
languages were supposed to co-exist; they were indeed
the home of two languages, for the children were nearly
all Slovene, whereas the teacher and the language he used
were German. Among 230 masters only 20 could read
and write Slovene. Qualified teachers who could satisfy
this test were, as we have mentioned, sent to other parts
of the Empire. So far did the system go that Slovene
peasants upon whom the Government had forced a
German education speedily forgot the two hundred words
which they had learned, but as they had been taught no
other script than the German they were accustomed to
write the Slovene language with German Gothic characters.
These peasants were fairly impervious to Germanization;
their strong sense of national consciousness
was supported by the books, religious and otherwise,
which they received every year from some such
society as that of St. Hermagoras at Celovec, which
distributed half a million books a year among its 90,000
members.</p>

<p>But that which principally guided the peasant was
the voice of his priest, and the vast majority of priests
in zone "A" were Slovenes. This agricultural zone
possesses no more than one or two small towns, where
the priest is less <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'regarded,'">regarded.</ins> The traders and artisans
frequently look upon themselves as too highly cultured
for the Church; they affect the "Los von Rom" and
the Socialist movements. By holding these menaces over
the Bishop's head a good deal of pressure could be brought
to bear, and this was done by the Germans, who were of
opinion that the Church unfairly encouraged the Slovenes.
The Bishop of Celovec had both the zones in his diocese
until some months before the plebiscite, when a temporary
arrangement was made under which zone "A"
was administered by a vicar. But in bygone years the
Bishop, with these threats hanging over him, was wont
to counsel prudence and to ask his clergy not to agitate
their flock, whom they were merely telling of their rights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
In zone "B," which mostly consists of the town of
Celovec, the Church would naturally be more susceptible
to German influence, apart from the fact that the Bishop
himself is a Bavarian. For personal reasons&mdash;he is very
imperfectly acquainted with the Slovene language&mdash;he
wished even the clergy of zone "A" to correspond with
him in German; but the priests pointed out that their
faithful parishioners wanted to follow this correspondence
and by far the greater number of them have no
German.... In fact the Church has in each zone brought
its help to the more powerful party&mdash;the Slovene peasants
in zone "A" and the German or Germanophil townsfolk in
zone "B"; and it appeared probable before the plebiscite
that in both cases she would be on the victorious side.</p>

<p>In foretelling the result of the plebiscite one would not
pay much attention to the census which the German-Austrian
officials used to take. A person was inscribed
according to the language he ordinarily employed, and
this was, more often than not, considered to be German
if his superior was a German. Before the census of
1910 the <i>Grazer Tagblatt</i>, which is the Germans' chief
organ in those parts, proclaimed that the official census
was a portion of the national propaganda. All the
propagandist societies were entreated to do their utmost
to induce the people to declare German as their usual
language. Very humorous results were obtained. On
December 18, 1910, the provincial council of public
instruction gave out the number of German and Slovene
children respectively in thirty Slovene parishes. Amongst
them were the following:</p>

<table summary="statistics" style="font-size: 90%">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>German Children.</td><td style="padding-left: 2em">Slovene Children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="leftalign" style="padding-right: 4em">Borovlje (Ferlach)</td><td class="leftalign"> 31 per cent.</td><td class="leftalign" style="padding-left: 2em"> 69 per cent.</td></tr>

<p>And twelve days later the official census gave these
results:</p>

<table summary="statistics" style="font-size: 90%">

<p>Far more trustworthy is the almanac issued every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
year by the Church, wherein a person's "usual language"
is taken to be that in which he listens to the word of God.
These ecclesiastical lists were published by German
bishops, and according to them we find that the region
we are considering held in 1910 some 40,000 Germans and
123,000 Slovenes.</p>

<p>We have seen that Celovec, like the smaller towns in
this area, leans more to the Austrians than to the Yugoslavs.
This is partly the effect of the Austrian Government's
policy and partly of the various pan-German
societies (<i>e.g.</i> the "K&auml;rntner Bauernbund," the "Verein
der Alldeutschen," the "Deutscher Volksverein," etc.
etc.), which, as was admitted, drew their funds to a considerable
extent from Germany herself.</p>

<p>The German Republic was very lavish in assisting
her smaller Austrian sister during the period before the
plebiscite, pouring both goods and cash into the district;
and after the opening of the demarcation line between
the two zones at the beginning of August they were able
to introduce their supplies quite openly into zone "A."
Very few Germans of the north believe that the German-Austrian
Republic will permanently remain separated
from themselves.... Both Yugoslavs and Austrians
circulated vast quantities of printed matter; for the
Yugoslavs the most convincing argument lay in Austria's
apparently hopeless economic position and the undesirability
of belonging to a State which had to pay so huge
a debt; the Austrian pamphlets denounced the Serbs
as a military race, though even such a dealer in false
evidence as the eminent Austrian historian, Dr. Friedjung,
would find it difficult to sustain the thesis that the wars
engaged in by the Serbs during the last hundred years
were more of an offensive than of a defensive character.
In several prettily prepared handbooks the voters were
implored by the Austrians not to be so old-fashioned as
to plump for a monarchy when they had such a chance of
becoming republicans; one could almost see the writer
of these scornful phrases stop to wipe his over-heated
brow after having pushed back his old Imperial and
Royal headgear. You might imagine that the Austrians
in their deplorable economic condition would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
avoided this topic; on the contrary, they proclaimed
that several commodities which were lacking in Yugoslavia
could be furnished by them in abundance. One
of these, they said, was salt; and certainly the Yugoslavs
purchased a good deal of it, but that was only when
they did not know that it was German salt, which the
Austrians bought in that country and on which they
made an adequate profit. When the Yugoslavs wanted
to get their supplies direct from Germany the Austrians
introduced a transit tax of 1000 crowns&mdash;not the nearly
worthless Austrian but Yugoslav crowns&mdash;per waggon.
Later on when the Danube was thrown open and this
tax could not be levied, salt was considerably cheaper in
Yugoslavia than in Austria. So with plums&mdash;in 1919
Austria bought nearly the whole of the exports from
Yugoslavia at six crowns per kilo and sold them to Germany
at eleven to twelve crowns, the profit going, so the
authorities said, to the poor.</p>

<p>As the day of the plebiscite approached, the Yugoslavs
seemed to be more confident than the Austrians. The
staunch peasants of zone "A" were not greatly impressed
by the numerous appeals to their heart and brain which
were handed to them by the Austrians in the Slovene
language. And they were not much alarmed at the
idea of being joined to their countrymen of the south,
those unmitigated Serbs who thrived, if one was to
believe the Austrian propaganda, on atrocities. But
this warning was ridiculed by the Austrians themselves&mdash;on
a market day at Velikovec you could see the Austrophils
wearing their colours, which they would scarcely
have done if they had been afraid of possible reprisals&mdash;and
zone "A" was generally presumed to have a Yugoslav
majority. On such a market day one saw very few
Yugoslav colours in the farmers' button-holes, for it
was the wish of their leaders to avoid anything which
might give rise to unnecessary conflict. The day drew
near and the Austrians thought that they were making
insufficient progress; for one thing, they were at a disadvantage
owing to the very low value of their money.
They hoped that Germany would come with more zeal
than ever to the rescue, and they hoped that something
fatal would occur to Yugoslavia. So they asked the Inter-Allied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Commissions to put it to their Governments that
it would be advisable if the plebiscite were to be postponed
for several months, say until May 1921. But it was
reported that the French and British representatives
declined to countenance the scheme. They may also
have feared that if the period of canvassing were to be so
long drawn out, the same passions would come to the
surface as in the plebiscite in east and west Prussia,
where in many places the Poles could not display their
sympathies except at great personal risk. But in that
particular plebiscite it must be noted that the Allies
were very imprudent in confiding the maintenance of
order to the rebaptized German Security Police, a body
which was entirely in the hands of the reactionary clique.
Yet the military precautions of zone "A" in Carinthia
were not what they should have been, for when the Yugoslavs
had lost the plebiscite an unrestrained horde of
Austrian sympathizers, some of them from that zone
and some from outside it, some of them civilians and
some of them soldiers in mufti who made for certain
places where supplies of weapons had been hidden,
swarmed across the land and terrorized the Yugoslavs
in such a fashion that a Yugoslav military force had to
come in to protect them. "But how barbaric are these
Yugoslavs," sneered their enemies, "for they refuse
to recognize the result of the plebiscite." More than
one diplomat in Belgrade was ordered to present himself
at the Foreign Office and demand an answer why,
etc. But the Yugoslavs had no intention of imitating
d'Annunzio.</p>

<p>Those who were not in the zone at the time of
the voting might well be astounded at the result, which
was an Austrian victory by 22,025 votes against 15,278
for Yugoslavia. In view of the undoubted Yugoslav
majority, it was felt that something more than active
propaganda, before and during the election, had been
brought to bear. For example, in the commune of
Grab&#353;tajn (Grafenstein) the Germans are said to have
inscribed on the electoral list 180 persons from Celovec
and Styria who had no right to vote; they also asked
that seventy strangers should be inscribed. On submitting
these claims to the judgment of the district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
council the German leaders, even as the Yugoslavs, were
required to initial each request; it is alleged that these
initialled papers, which were attached to the claims, were
left overnight in a room the key of which was in the
keeping of the German secretary, Schwarz. He is charged
with having removed the initialled papers from the Slovene
claims and affixed them to the German claims. There
was a large amount of more usual corruption. Thus it
is known that twenty-eight Slovene servants at an important
landowner's were unable to resist the material
arguments and voted for the Germans. And if it is true
that a number of people voted twice and even three
times the Inter-Allied Commission fell short of its duties.
It is said that the voting was so lax that if a stranger had
been inscribed and did not turn up to vote, his legitimation
was used by a native. Thus we are told of one
Helena Rozenzoph, aged seventy-five, who was inscribed
at Grab&#353;tajn. This woman had never existed; there had
been a certain Barbara Rozenzoph who died in 1919, and
her vote was used by Marjeta Hanzio, aged twenty-two
years. The case was so flagrant that the Commission
discovered it and the woman confessed to having acted
on a note which she had received from the special Austrian
<i>gendarmerie</i> force, the Heimatsdienst. The Commission
seems to have been reluctant to take any steps against
these frauds and it is not astonishing that the commune
of Grab&#353;tajn registered 1290 votes for the Austrian
Republic and only 380 for Yugoslavia, although in this
commune of 3440 inhabitants there are no more than
sixteen German families. A German majority was thus
obtained in a province which Dr. Renner, the Austrian
Chancellor, had acknowledged to be Slovene. It seems
incredible that the Commission should have so completely
broken down and the mystery may yet be cleared up,
if as the Yugoslavia delegate requested, all the voting
papers have been preserved.... But the <i>Hrvat</i>,
the organ of the Narodny Club in Croatia (the decentralizing
but strongly national party) blames Monsignor
Koro&#353;ec, the leader of the Slovene clericals, for the
disastrous plebiscite result. He would have been better
employed, it says, in organizing his people than in
gadding about Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Dalmatia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
for the purpose of extending his party. He had
boasted that the Slovenes were so well organized that
they were perfectly confident as to the issue. It would
seem, however, says the <i>Hrvat</i>, that an unexpectedly
large proportion of them are partly or entirely Germanized.
And this, more than the above-mentioned
irregularities, may be chiefly responsible for Yugoslavia's
loss. One must also remember that many a Slovene
would shrink from garrison duty in Macedonia, while it
would be very natural for the Carinthian farmer to look
up at the mountains that separated him from Carniola
and then to recollect that Celovec (Klagenfurt), the
economic centre of the whole area, would be Austrian.
Nevertheless if zone "A" had been smaller&mdash;and more
completely Slav&mdash;it is probable that the population
would have risen superior to the various doubts which
assailed them. What we have said about the Slovenes
who have become Germanized is borne out by the
<i>Koroski Slovenec</i>, a newspaper which appears in Vienna
and which, though since its formation has been essentially
hostile to the Austrians, tells us that after the plebiscite
the Slovenes have only suffered real oppression from
their denationalized compatriots. Difficulties arose with
regard to the closing of Slovene schools, but this was
largely due to the fact that many of the Slovene schoolmasters
fled to Yugoslavia.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>g</i>) <span class="smcap">The Italian Frontier</span></p>

<p>A Yugoslav barrister from Pola had gone to a neighbouring
village&mdash;this was in 1920&mdash;for the purpose of
encouraging the natives, who were all Southern Slavs.
He asked them, in the event of their part of Istria being
allotted to the Italians, not to lose heart but to wait for
the day when justice would come by her own. In the
middle of his exhortations a jovial old farmer approached
him and slapped him on the back. "Cheer up, young
man!" he exclaimed. "What is it that you are afraid
of?" ... The Slav population of Istria and Gorica-Gradi&#353;ca,
even as that of Dalmatia, has endured a great
many things and is prepared to endure a great many
more. Kindness would have gone a long way towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
disarming them. If the Italians on the eastern Adriatic
had been exponents of the Mazzini spirit rather than&mdash;which
too often has been the case&mdash;of the direst
Nationalist, then the Yugoslavs would have accepted&mdash;mournfully,
no doubt, but <i>faute de mieux</i>&mdash;the frontier
from the river Ar&#353;a in Istria which President Wilson
suggested. This would have been a compromise frontier,
by which 400,000 Slovenes and Croats would fall to Italy
and a very much smaller number of Italians would fall
to Yugoslavia. It would have satisfied the great sensible
mass of the Italian people, but unfortunately was rejected
by Baron Sonnino and his myrmidons. Far more was
claimed by him, and the succeeding Italian Governments
have had to struggle with the passions he so recklessly
aroused. They have been unable to persuade the country
that with the Ar&#353;a frontier they would be getting by no
means a bad bargain. By the Treaty of Rapallo the
Italians have obtained much more: the whole of Gorica-Gradi&#353;ca,
portions of Carniola, the whole of Istria and
contiguity with Rieka (which is made a free town), the
islands of Lussin, Cres and Unie, sovereignty over a strip
of five miles which includes Zadar (and a few adjacent
islands), finally the southern island of Lastovo and
Pelagosa which lies in the middle of the Adriatic.</p>

<p>In November 1920 all the outside world was congratulating
the Italians and the Yugoslavs on having,
after many fruitless efforts of their statesmen, come to
this agreement. The opinion was expressed that both of
the contracting parties would henceforth be satisfied,
since each of them was conscious that the other had
accepted something less than his desires. It was noted
that the Yugoslavs exhibited more generosity, as they
gave up some half a million of their countrymen, while
the Italians yielded in Dalmatia that to which they had
no right. The Yugoslavs had, in the past two years,
shown so much more forbearance than was usually expected
of a vigorous young nation that the commentators
for the most part fancied they would not waste any time
in grieving over these inevitable sacrifices. It is freely
said that if a liberal spirit is displayed by the Italians at
the various points where they and Yugoslavia are in
contact, both people will settle down, with no afterthoughts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
to friendly and neighbourly relations. But it
would be foolish to close our eyes to the fact that the
position at Rieka and Zadar, not to speak of any other
places, bristles with difficulties. At Rieka one hopes
that the largest and wisest party, the Autonomists, will
now come into their rights; no doubt a good many of
those opportunist citizens who, at the time of the Italian
occupation, developed into Italianissimi, after having
previously been known as more or less platonic lovers of
Italy, Hungary, or Croatia with ambitions chiefly centred
on their native town, will presently assure you that in
the Free State they are convinced Free Staters; but the
local politicians have been living for so long in such a
thoroughly oppressive atmosphere that most of those
who have been prominent should for a season now retire.
It will be difficult enough for this harassed port to settle
down to business. As for the Zadar enclave, it is not
easy to understand why an Italian majority in this little
town should bring it under the Italian flag while the
overwhelming Slav majorities of central and eastern Istria
have been ignored. And with all the goodwill in the
world the existence of this minute colony encircled by
Yugoslav lands will scarcely make more easy the conduct
of relations between Yugoslavia and Italy. It is naturally
to the interest of both countries that misunderstandings
and suspicions should be swept away. And from this
point of view it is very doubtful whether the Italians
were well advised in taking Zadar into their possession.
Presumably the Government was forced to do so by the
state of public feeling. They withstood this feeling with
regard to the magnificent harbour of Vis, which even
President Wilson suggested they should have, and contented
themselves with the smaller Yugoslav island of
Lastovo (Lagosta). The pity is that the Nationalists
should have forced into their hands anything which may
turn and sting them.</p>

<p>It may be thought that we are excessively pessimistic
in pointing rather to the dangers which the Treaty places
on the tapis than to the good sense of those who will
deal with them. We do not say that the Italians would
have permitted their Government to solve the Adriatic
question in a safer and more philosophic manner; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
we cannot look forward with that confidence we should
have had if more sagacious counsels had prevailed.</p>

<p>An arrangement most agreeable to the bulk of the
interested population would have been effected if two
Free States, instead of one, had been created: the small
one of Rieka, and a larger one embracing Triest and the
western part of Istria. There would be in each of these
two States a mixed population, who would think with a
shudder of the time when the grass was growing on their
quays. Italians and Slavs, prosperous as of old, would
very cordially agree that the experiment of being included
in Italy had been at any rate a commercial disaster.
[D'Annunzio's administration was, of course, a mere
camouflage. Without the support of the Italian Government,
which paid his troops though calling them rebels,
the poet-adventurer could scarcely have lasted for a day;
and the swarm of officers, many of them worse adventurers
than himself, would have deserted him. Nor
would the population of Rieka have listened to his glowing
periods if the Italian Government had not, under cover
of the Red Cross, sent an adequate supply of food into
the town.] Both Rieka and Triest were, therefore, living
under practically the same conditions, separated from
their natural hinterland, and knowing very well that
as Italian towns their prospects were lamentable. It
was significant that the Italian Government should after
a time have studied the scheme of constructing a canal
from Triest to the Save. Before the War one-third of
the urban population (and all the surrounding country)
was Yugoslav; and now, when so many Yugoslavs have
departed and so many Italians have arrived, even now
it is certain that in a plebiscite not 10 per cent. would
vote for Italy&mdash;and this minority would be largely made
up of those <i>leccapiatini</i> (the "plate-lickers") who were
the humbler servants of Austria during the War and are
now begging for Italian plates. When the offices of the
Socialist newspaper <i>Il Lavoratore</i>&mdash;the Socialists are
by far the most important party in Triest&mdash;were taken
by storm and gutted, the American Consul, Mr. Joseph
Haven, and the Paris correspondent of the <i>New York
Herald</i>, Mr. Eyre, happened to be in the building. They
afterwards said that the attack by those ultra-nationalist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
bands, the fascisti&mdash;very young men, demobilized junior
officers and so forth&mdash;was entirely unprovoked. The
carabinieri gazed indifferently at the scene. Such is life
in Triest, where the labour movement is gaining in
strength every day. Its old prosperity has departed&mdash;there
is hardly any trade or water or gas, since most of
the coal was consumed, by order of the Italian authorities,
in making electric light for illuminations. These were
intended to show the city's irrepressible enthusiasm at
being incorporated in the kingdom of Italy. But the
inhabitants know very well that being one of Italy's
many ports is worse than being the only port of Austria;
they know that the most direct railways to Austria pass
through Yugoslav territory, that henceforward the
Danube will be much more largely used by Austria,
Czecho-Slovakia and Hungary (none of whom had a seaboard)
and that Rieka will now be a more formidable
rival than of old.... So, too, at Pola we find that a
majority of the population do not wish their town to be
retained in Italy; a number of Italian workmen fled
from the idle shipbuilding yards and actually came in
1919 and 1920 with the Slovene refugees, their fellow-townsmen,
to Ljubljana in search of employment. There
are not sufficient orders to go round among such yards
in Italy where, owing to the absence of coal and iron,
this particular industry labours under great disadvantages.
But if Rome considers that the retention of Pola is
strategically essential, then in order to meet her wishes
this town might be taken out of the Triest-Istrian Free
State&mdash;maybe the Italians will be able to do something
that will cause the citizens to cease regretting those
good days of old when, as Austria's chief naval base, she
flourished on the largesse of officers and men. But what
can she do, and what could anybody do? Hundreds of
houses are deserted; and for the year 1920 the owners
of the theatre&mdash;which did not engage expensive actors
but relied mainly on cinema&mdash;were faced with a deficit
of 12,000 lire.</p>

<p>The Triest-Istrian Free State would approximately
contain, without Pola, some 300,000 inhabitants, half
Italian and half Yugoslav. The formation of this State
would be less advantageous to the Yugoslavs, for most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of the big landowners and the shop-keepers are Italians
who live on the Yugoslav peasants; but Yugoslavia,
for the sake of peace, would be glad to see the State
come into existence. Eastern and central Istria, forming
a part of Yugoslavia and lying between the two Free
States, should extend to Porto di Bado, which would
cause it to possess about 3,000 Italians and 280,000
Yugoslavs. If it were to be bounded by the Ar&#353;a it
would make the Italians in the Triest-Istrian State
become a minority.</p>

<p>With respect to the indisputable Slav districts east
of the Isonzo, <i>i.e.</i> the territory of Gorica-Gradi&#353;ca and
an appreciable part of Carniola, which have been adjudged
to Italy and which long to be joined to the Yugoslav
State, there are two possible solutions. (In passing we
may observe that there is no country where the national
frontier is more clearly indicated. The linguistic frontier
is so strictly defined that the peasant on one side of it
does not speak Italian and his neighbour on the other side
does not understand the Slovene tongue. Nevertheless,
Signor Colajanni, the venerable leader of the Italian
Republicans, took up an undemocratic point of view
and declined to admit the argument of the superiority
of numbers, when he alluded to this frontier in a speech
to the Republican Congress at Naples. Waving numbers
aside, he preferred to appeal to history and culture,
though he should have known that the mass of the
Slovene people is much better educated than the Italian
peasant.) The true ethnographical boundary would be the
Isonzo&mdash;not many Yugoslavs live to the west and not
many Italians to the east of that river. Only in the town
of Gorica do we find Italians. In 1910 at the census
the Italian municipal authorities attempted to show that
their town was almost entirely Italian; at a subsequent
census the Austrians found that the returns had been
largely falsified, and that in reality Gorica contained
14,000 Italians and 12,000 Slovenes, while it is common
knowledge that if you go 500 yards from the town you
meet nothing but Slovenes. The prosperity of Gorica
was mostly based on the export of fruit and vegetables
from the Slovene countryside. In 1898 the Slovenes
awakened, formed societies, started in business on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
large scale and boycotted the Italian merchants, who
found themselves obliged to learn the Slovene language.
Suppose that, for the sake of meeting the wishes of the
Italian Nationalists, one half of the town were given to
Italy, then that portion would be faced with ruin. It
would, therefore, be advisable that the whole town
should remain with its hinterland, and that Italy and
Yugoslavia should be divided from each other by the
Isonzo. But if this solution is impossible, then a large
district east of the Isonzo should be entirely and permanently
neutralized, which would not endanger the
security of either State. Very different in character is
the line Triglav-Idria-Sneznik, which the Italians hold
ostensibly as a means of defence, but which is an offensive
line against Yugoslavia, and primarily against Ljubljana
and Karlovac.</p>

<p>No doubt as the Italians in the eastern Adriatic have
obtained a regular position by the Treaty of Rapallo
they will henceforth do their best to win the love of
their new subjects. They will disavow such officers as
that one on the sandy isle of Unie who accused the
Slav priest of propaganda, and in fact, as we have
mentioned elsewhere, expelled him for the reason that
inside his church, where they had been for many years,
stood monuments of the two Slav apostles, SS. Cyril
and Methodus. St. Methodus was the wise administrator
of these two&mdash;but even if he takes the rulers of
the eastern Adriatic under his particular protection one
must be prepared for them to fail in smothering, by their
enlightened rule, the discontent which in the last three
years has grown among the Yugoslavs to such acute
proportions. It began, as we have noted, under the
&aelig;gis of Baron Sonnino; the old neighbour, Austria-Hungary,
had been Italy's hereditary foe, and the Baron's
school could not bring itself to regard the new neighbours
in a friendly light, although their house was so much
less populated than that of their predecessors, not to
mention that of the Italians themselves.</p>

<p>There have been times during the last three years
when a war between Italy and Yugoslavia seemed scarcely
avoidable&mdash;the natives of the districts most concerned
were looking forward to it with eagerness. At a Yugoslav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
assembly held in Triest in the summer of 1919 the other
delegates were electrified by two priests from Istria who
declared that their people were straining at the leash,
anxious for the word to snatch up their weapons. (Many
of these weapons, by the way, were of Italian origin, as
there had been no great difficulty in purchasing them
from the more pacific or the more Socialistic Italian
soldiers; the usual price was ten lire for a rifle and a
hundred rounds.) If there should come about a war
between Italy and Yugoslavia, then it is to be supposed
that the Yugoslavs will afterwards take as their western
frontier the old frontier of Austria (except for the Friuli
district, south of Cormons, which they do not covet,
since they look upon this ancient race as Italian.)</p>

<p>By signing the Treaty of Rapallo the Yugoslav Government
has shown that it is ready to go to very great lengths
in order to establish, as securely as may be, an era of peace.
It would be just as creditable on the part of the Italians
if they will consent to Istria being partitioned in the way
we have suggested, for they have been wrongly taught
to think themselves entitled to this country, and to believe
that the inhabitants, as a whole, are glad to be Italian
subjects. "You may suppose we are unpatriotic," the
Austrian railway officials of Italian nationality used to
say, "but as Austria gives much better pay than we
should receive from Italy, we prefer that this part of the
world should be Austrian."</p>

<p>The relations between Italy and Yugoslavia have been
treated at some length, for it would require but little to
bring a gathering of storm-clouds to the sky. One even
hears of Roman Catholics in Istria and elsewhere abjuring
their Church and&mdash;for the national cause&mdash;adopting the
Serbian Orthodox faith. Twenty years ago it happened
that two Istrian villages, Ricmanje and Log, went over
to the Uniate and thence to the Orthodox Church. This
was on account of a quarrel with the Bishop of Triest, who
wanted, against the wishes of the people, to remove their
priest, Dr. Pojar. But now we have priests in the provinces
given to Italy who are openly calling on their
flock to go over with them to their Orthodox brothers;
and this is a movement which, it is thought, will merely
be postponed by the introduction of the Slav liturgy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
To take a single sermon out of many, we may mention
one which in the summer of 1920 was preached in a church
of the Vipava valley. The clergyman, after lamenting
that the chief dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church
are Italians, gave it as his opinion that there was nothing
to choose in point of goodness between that particular
Church and the Orthodox Church. "And," said an old
peasant who came to Triest with the story of what had
happened, "never in my life did I hear so fine a sermon
and one that did me so much good."</p>

early in the European War, and this of course developed into something
else. That ingenuous propagandist, Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Goad, tells us (in the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i> of May 1922) that while Nature had made the innumerable
deep-water harbours on the eastern coast of the Adriatic practically
immune from Italy's attack, a landing or raid from one of them at Ancona,
Bari or Barletta would be a vital blow at Italy, severing vital communications.
He therefore justifies Italy's landing at Valona in that it was a
purely defensive step, made to ensure that its harbour should not be used
against her. He may hold that the seizure of one town is better than
the seizure of none, but from the strategic and political point of view
it would seem that Mr. Goad is an injudicious advocate.</p></div>

their honour or of cash. When, to give an example, Scutari was occupied
by the Montenegrins at the beginning of the Great War, a Catholic Albanian
merchant came to a Montenegrin lawyer and asked him to institute
proceedings against another merchant who had gravely and publicly
insulted him. The lawyer drew up the complaint, for which he charged
the small sum of 20 perpers (= francs), but although his client was a
wealthy man this fee appalled him; he resolved to take no further steps.
In general, the Scutarenes prefer to suffer imprisonment rather than
part with any money. And the willingness of the Albanians not to look
a gift-horse in the mouth could often be observed at Podgorica between
the years 1909 and 1912, when Nicholas of Montenegro would occasionally
appear in the market-place with a supply of caps and other articles for the
Albanians. These he would distribute, having first exclaimed: "Ka&#269;ak
Karadak Kralj Nikola barabar!" (that is to say, "The Albanian and
the Montenegrin are equal in the eyes of King Nicholas!"). Ka&#269;ak is
a word meaning a brigand, an outlaw; the Montenegrins apply it to
their neighbours, and these latter, throwing their new caps in the air
and cheering for Nikita, did not mind what he called them.</p></div>

they discovered among the inhabitants of that place a man who had not
left his house for some fourteen years. We are told (in <i>The Complete
Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland</i>, etc., vol. v. London, 1921) of my
Lord Eyre of Eyrescourt in County Galway "that not one of the windows
of his castle was made to open, but luckily he had no liking for fresh air."
Yet probably his lordship's countenance had not the pallor of the man
of Pri&#353;tina, because "from an early dinner to the hour of rest he never
left his chair, nor did the claret ever quit the table."</p></div>

mention that he employs a reviewer who, referring to the map in my

<h3>CONCLUSION: A FEW NATIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS</h3>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Slovenes and the Serbs&mdash;The Montenegrins and the Serbs&mdash;The
Croats and the Serbs&mdash;Serb and Bulgar.</span></p>


<p class="section">THE SLOVENES AND THE SERBS</p>

<p>Those who, for some reason or other, do not love the
Yugoslavs will have said to themselves, before taking up
this book, that they would certainly supply that searching
criticism of this people which the author would omit.
They knew it was unlikely that a man would write at such
excessive length about the Southern Slavs if he had not a
weakness for them, and if he predicted for their State the
virtue of cohesion or more than very moderate tranquillity,
his prejudice would have to be discounted. "The Yugoslavs,"
said an Italian lady to me in London, and her
beautiful lips looked as if they could scarcely bring themselves
to pronounce the name, "the Yugoslavs," she
said, "are very wild and black." If I have given the
impression in this book that they are white, my fault will
be much greater than the lady's, since I am not quite a
stranger to them. Slovenes, Croats, Serbs and Bulgars&mdash;they
have good and evil qualities so different that one
must take them separately, and perhaps it will be more
instructive to compare them with each other. The
Slovenes need not detain us; they are a small people
occupying a surprisingly large area; if they were less well
organized they would have been long ago swallowed up.
They shine as workers in the field and mine and forest
much more than as military men. They have never
been hereditary soldiers, like so many of the Croats, and
it is perhaps this want of confidence in their own military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
prowess which has caused them to take measures that are
sometimes too severe against the Austrians who are under
them. The Bosnian Moslems assert that, as all their
links with Turkey are now broken, they are the best
Yugoslavs. But the Slovenes are also the best Yugoslavs,
because they recognize that in Yugoslavia is their
sole salvation. Some of us may regret that their tenacity
so far outstrips their idealism. They are a careful people,
as may be seen from Order No. 17024 which was issued,
on December 4, 1920, by the Prefecture of Ljutomir.
Referring to sequestered property, it enjoined that the
Austrian owner should be allowed so much that he could
live on it, but not so much as to enable him to be extravagant.
They are also a relatively well-educated people;
according to official statistics of 1910, 85&middot;34 per cent. of
the Slovene population know how to read and write, while
their neighbours to the east, the Magyars, can only
reckon 62 per cent. and the Italians of pre-war Italy,
62&middot;4 per cent. The most backward part of the Slovene
race, those of Istria, have 46&middot;6 per cent. of illiterates,
while there are Italian provinces where the illiterates
amount even to 85 per cent. Rome itself counts 65 per
cent.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>


<p class="section">THE MONTENEGRINS AND THE SERBS</p>

<p>It will be profitable to compare the Montenegrins with
the Serbs, because in our impatience with those persons
who would keep them separate we may have seemed to
imply that we believe them identical. The Serbs who
maintained themselves in those mountains developed
certain characteristics which differentiate them from their
brothers. The Serb of the old kingdom walks, the Serb
of the mountain struts. The magnificent Serbian warrior
of the kingdom is so disciplined that although a Field-Marshal
will sit down openly in a caf&eacute; and drink wine
with some old comrade who is in the ranks, yet when the
soldier is on duty his obedience is perfect. But if the
Montenegrin private thinks that his officer has rebuked
him unjustly, he will not hesitate to kill him. The Serb
has a great respect for the national heroes, while every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>Montenegrin (for the sake of brevity we will use this term
instead of "Serb of Montenegro," and imply, when using
the word Serb, a Serb of the old kingdom)&mdash;as we have
said, a Serb respects the national heroes, while every
Montenegrin has a knowledge of his own ancestors for at
least a hundred years. He is a chivalrous person who
wishes to be treated as at least your equal. It was the
Serbs' disregard of this sentiment which now and then
gave umbrage to those Montenegrins who had expected
that their union with the Serbs would cause an immediate
return of the golden age. This was almost as offensive
to the Montenegrins as the request that they would now
contribute towards the support of the army. They had
always left this to the Tzar&mdash;"We and the Russians,"
they used to say, "are 150 millions." Not all the
Montenegrins have managed to emancipate themselves
from the thraldom of the clan. An amusing example of
this was a major at Pe&#263; who belonged to the great Vasojevi&#263;
family. He gave two of us a large lorry, which
was the only car he had, and advised us to start very early
and to take no one with us, except a guard, as the road
to Mitrovica was in a soft condition. We started off with
about twenty passengers, but only one of them, a Turk,
had any luggage to speak of; and after we had gone a
good part of the way we were held up at a military post.
A Montenegrin captain, also a member of the Vasojevi&#263;,
had overslept himself and ordered us by telephone to
return for him. The Serbian lieutenant&mdash;who had risen
from the ranks&mdash;asked at once if that order would come in
writing, and when he received a negative answer he cut off
the communication and wished us a happy journey. The
Montenegrins also differ from the Serbs in their cultivation
of the arts. They have no liking for songs of love, but
say that men should only listen to the guslar and to hero-songs.
They are severer and more dignified than the
Serbs, and it will be some time before the average Montenegrin
throws back his head in a railway carriage and
rolls out a joyous song, as I once heard a Serb do in the
Banat, whereupon another Serb in the far corner&mdash;they
obviously had never met&mdash;joined in the song with great
heartiness. The Montenegrin says that the Serb chatters
like a gipsy (though we must not forget that, as Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Durham remarked,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> he is hurt if things Serbian are
criticized by an outsider); he has been told that the
Englishman is grave, like himself, and therefore he
appreciates him from afar. But not many Englishmen
(or Serbs) would care to indulge, like the Montenegrins,
in the ceaseless recapitulation of time-honoured exploits.
The younger folk are not so faithful to these ancient
stories, but it is in Montenegro that performers on the
one-stringed, monotonous guslar can most easily find an
audience. The Serbs of the kingdom have become more
eclectic in musical matters, though even with them the
popular taste is in favour of the man who snores, on the
grounds that he is hearty and robust. In so far as foreign
influence is concerned, the Montenegrin has been to some
extent affected by Italian culture, while that of Greece
and Germany has acted on the Serb. But the Great War
had an equally unfortunate influence on both of them.
One must, however, mention that long before the War,
and owing partly to Albanian influence, partly to their
own struggle for existence and partly to other causes,
the Montenegrins had shown themselves defective in
straightforwardness. Undoubtedly they had deteriorated
under the example of Nikita, but this unfortunate trait
can also be discerned between the lines of the great poem,
the "Gorski Venac," written in the first half of the
nineteenth century. There used to be a certain amount
of what we call theft in Montenegro, but the natives of
that country, as of Albania, cherished rather communistic
ideas; it seemed to them that they had a sort of right to
that which another possessed, particularly if he was a
near relative. After the War the Montenegrin was so
much impoverished that he stole more freely, and the Serb,
whose hands had hitherto been remarkably clean, took to
the same habits and often in a very amateur fashion.
Thus in a Macedonian village where a British army store
had been rifled, the officers turned to the local priest, who
was indignant with his people and conducted the officers
into every house. Nothing was discovered, and the priest
proposed that his own house should be searched. He
was told that this was unnecessary, but he insisted; and
when his careless wife led the way up a ladder into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>loft a British officer perceived at any rate one pair of khaki
breeches. The patients of the Scottish Women's Hospital
at Belgrade were so unpractised in the art of stealing
that one of them&mdash;a typical case&mdash;returned one day to
have her leg attended to, and in raising her skirt revealed
on the petticoat, which had once been a tablecloth, a
large "S.W.H." These felonious ways are in contrast
with the usual Serb candour. One afternoon in Belgrade
I was searching for a small street in a district which I
had not visited before. When at last, after many
inquiries, I came to within fifty yards of it I found a
policeman&mdash;but it is only fair to say that the majority
of the force consisted at this time of soldiers recently
disbanded. When I asked him where the street might be,
the good man thought a while and then, throwing back
his open hand and giving up the problem in despair, said,
"My God, I know not."</p>

<p>The wave of crime has manifested itself differently
among the Serbs and the Montenegrins, in that the latter
have been more primitive and have consummated their
plundering by assassination&mdash;and this in a country where
between 1895 and 1913 only two men were murdered for
their money. In Serbia the people, even in the terrible
distress after the War, did not go to such lengths. During
the first half-year, the only two cases of unnatural death
in the whole district of &#268;a&#269;ak, where I spent a couple of
months, were both of them suicides, an old man hanging
himself on account of the death of his last remaining
soldier son, and an officer's wife, who had been too friendly
to an Austrian, throwing herself into a well on her
husband's return. A certain village of the same district
is an instance of the frequency of all those minor peccadilloes,
such as drunkenness and rowdiness and so forth,
which the Serbs permit themselves. There is a law which
lays it down that the mayor must be a native and must
be a man who never has been lodged in gaol. But
that unhappy village in the &#268;a&#269;ak region is unable to
produce a single adult man with such a record.... If
the Serb of the old kingdom is a more easy-going individual
than his brother of the mountains it is quite erroneous to
think that they dislike each other or have not resolved to
come together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE CROATS AND THE SERBS</p>

<p>Some of Yugoslavia's neighbours were anxious, during
the months which followed the War, that we should learn
how Serb and Croat were continually at each other's
throat. The dissensions between the two branches of
the Yugoslav family would have been much more serious
and more prolonged if their neighbours had paid less
attention to them. It is true that "our Serbian customs,"
in the words of Ja&#353;a Tomi&#263;, "come from the village, while
those of the Croats come from the nobles." The humbler
Croat, one may say, was an employee in a big store, while
the Serb was a small trader. The Croat would naturally
like to introduce the big-store system into Yugoslavia,
but this the Serb does not understand. He has a greater
sense of responsibility and is more careful with regard to
the expenses. To the Croat, in the old Empire, it was
immaterial whether the officials were more or less costly.
The bill was paid by Austria, who was the foe. For some
time the Croat found himself forgetting that he was in
Yugoslavia. When Cardinal Bourne came to Zagreb in
the spring of 1919 and the town-hall was decorated with
the British, Croatian, Serbian, Slovene and the town
flag, some one asked the mayor why the State flag had
been omitted. He was horrified. "The State flag!"
he cried. Then it dawned upon him.... Numbers of
Croats have belonged to the governing class and&mdash;impelled
by the Catholic religion&mdash;have displayed more
devotion to the arts than to the freedom of their country.
On the other hand the Serbs, a race of practical peasants,
have a highly developed national consciousness. This
they owe partly to their inborn political gifts and largely
to their Church, for the Orthodox religion&mdash;one may
say, I think, without injustice&mdash;has more frequently
shown itself, so closely is it connected with the idea of the
State, to be rather of this world than of another. One
should say the Orthodox religion as it flourishes in the
Balkans, for when the Russian General Bobrikoff, who
was attached to the person of King Milan, came back
with him to Belgrade after the Peace of San Stefano, he
was scandalized to see that religion had no greater share
in the national rejoicings. "Accustomed as I was in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
own country," he said, "to see nothing done without
prayers and the blessing of the Church, I was indeed
astounded to observe that the priests played the part of
officials even in the cathedral, and often were altogether
absent." This reminds one of von Baernreiter, who
wished to learn the Serbian language, so that he would
be more eligible for the governorship of Bosnia. He
asked his teacher at Vienna when one could hear sermons
in the Serbian church, and was informed that these
occurred but twice a year and that on those occasions
everybody left the church. The Serb and the Bulgar
have come to neglect our distinctions between that which
is spiritual and that which is temporal; their religion is,
in consequence of their history, so inherent a part of the
nation's life that in losing it one would almost cease to
be a Serb or a Bulgar. Their Church is as national as
that of the Armenians.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This may not be an ideal state
of things, but it prevailed in Spain under the Moorish
oppression and in the France of Jeanne d'Arc. During
the crisis of the Great War the churches in the West
were everywhere national; and in Serbia it was calculated
that 60 per cent. of the sermons had a pronounced national
colouring....</p>

<p>Now with these differences between the Croat and
the Serb, does it not seem strange that the vast majority
of them are for union, with a part of this majority in
favour of a reasonable decentralization? But if we
investigate the motives of the Serbs and Croats who
would thwart this union, we will see that they have
nothing of that faith which, after all these centuries, has
moved the Yugoslav multitude. Some of the Serbs wish
to keep aloof on the ground that Serbia in the last hundred
years has borne the brunt of the battle&mdash;and this, whether
they were or were not faced with a more difficult situation,
is acknowledged by most of the Croats, who for that
reason would never dream of wishing the more modern
Zagreb to supplant Belgrade. Those few Croats who are
not for Yugoslavia are moved by ecclesiastical prejudice
or by their longing for the privileges which the Habsburgs
granted them. But those who, for various reasons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>criticize the central Government are by no means necessarily
in favour of setting up a separate one. Whatever the
impetuous Radi&#263; may have said, he is out for Yugoslavia.
Still one cannot be astonished that he was sometimes
misunderstood. The Zagreb students who, towards the
end of 1918, came to Svetozar Pribi&#269;evi&#263; with the request
that he would let them kill the demagogue, were for
expressing in this way what Dr. Du&#353;an Popovi&#263;, the well-known
deputy, expressed in another. It was at the
Zagreb Provincial Parliament that he exclaimed, in the
summer of 1918, that "This idea will be victorious and
therefore I say publicly, in the presence of the whole
people, that I am a Croat, a Serb and a Slovene, or, if
you prefer it, none of them but merely a Yugoslav."
In 1914 when Stamboul&uuml;sky, the future Prime Minister of
Bulgaria, was arrested and accused of Serbophilism, he
declared: "I am neither Bulgar or Serb; I am a Yugoslav!" ...
For at least a generation Zagreb will remain
particularist, zealously preserving the differences&mdash;personal,
social and religious&mdash;which distinguish her
people from the dominant Serbs. The Croat officers who
burned with shame at the Archduke's murder on Bosnian
soil, the Croat regiments that in 1915 marched into
Belgrade with bands playing and their colours flying, the
Croat officials whose bread and salt came from the Habsburgs
in administering Yugoslav countries during the
War&mdash;all these will not forget a long, deep-rooted and
honourable tradition. But Zagreb is now even as Munich
was in 1866; after having been the Rome of the Yugoslav
movement, the seat of its philosophy and the centre
of its politics, the Croat capital has now an atmosphere
of sad futility, for Belgrade is the beacon of the Yugoslav
world. While comparing Zagreb with Rome one must
add that she had also the misfortune to resemble Rome
of the decadence&mdash;a good deal of outer polish was imparted
by the Austrians, at the expense of their victims' backbone.
The five centuries of Turkish domination had no
such demoralizing influence upon the Serbs, especially
not in the country places. In the opinion of a very close
observer,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> whom I quote, there is nothing that so
thoroughly displays the dominance of Belgrade as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>agrarian problem. The projected reforms, which have
been based on the principle that no one should own more
land than he can cultivate with the aid of his family,
would dispossess large numbers of big landowners in
Croatia and still larger numbers of men with moderate
holdings, whose compensation would be "determined
hereafter." The application of these reforms has been
delayed for various reasons, but nowhere at any time
has it been suggested that Croatia might reject them.
In the old kingdom of Serbia, with much the greater
part of the land in peasant possession, it may be said
that there is no agrarian problem.... Those enemies
of Yugoslavia, by the way, who have hoped that the
particularism of Croatia would be something altogether
different from what it is, should have mingled with the
crowd at Zagreb on the evening of Prince Alexander's
arrival in July 1920. The Prince interrupted his dinner,
came out on to the balcony and made a speech. "Draga
moja bratjo Hrvati," he said&mdash;"Croatians, my dear
brothers." Not for a thousand years had a ruler of
Croatia addressed his people in their own tongue. One
immense roar of delight broke, as the <i>Morning Post's</i>
special correspondent tells us, from the assembled multitude;
men fell on each other's necks, laughed, wept
and kissed each other.... Such manifestations must
not lead us to believe that all the internal problems of
the young State are settled. Croatia (as also Slovenia)
is jealous of her separate identity, suspicious to some
extent of Serbia, her prestige and projects; she has no
intention of allowing herself, after the hard fight against
Magyarization, to be "Balkanized." But one thing was
made clear by the Prince's visit: there can be no word or
thought of separation.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">We have spoken of the disaffection prevalent among
the Croats, and on this the world has fixed its eyes,
because of the large number of Croat deputies who have
hitherto declined to come to Belgrade. Nevertheless
there is a more general and more grievous discontent in
Yugoslavia, since, after all, the Croats' attitude is of a
temporary character&mdash;for it is probable that after the
next general election their peculiar upbringing will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
be so potent in determining their sentiments towards
the State. More and more will they be ready to make
common cause with Serbs and Slovenes; and their
criticisms, which are now so negative, will be of a more
useful kind. (They will recognize, for example, that if it
costs 3000 dinars to open an inn in Serbia they were
not justified in protesting when the fee in Croatia was
raised from 5 crowns to 5 dinars.) That Yugoslavia
gives ground for criticism no one, least of all her well-wishers,
deny. And those who pray that she will prosper
do so for the reason that the scattered Southern Slavs
have for the first time now been able&mdash;most of them at
any rate&mdash;to link their arms together; and we hope
that with high qualities outweighing their defects the
Southern Slavs will permanently take their place among
the nations. But this will not be brought about unless
those ailments which they suffer from are now confronted.
Serbs themselves are often saying that their little Serbia
was better than this fine new country which is thrice as
large. She had fewer problems, she had fewer parties,
and if people were corrupt they were so on a smaller
scale. Traditions which are deprecatingly called Balkan,
but which were at that time suited to a Balkan country,
should not be allowed to spread across a country which
is so much more than Balkan. Merit does not everywhere
in this imperfect world advance you automatically,
but an effort is required in Yugoslavia to resist the calls
of friendship in appointing men to offices. The army of
officials is too numerous; yet many of them are so badly
paid that even if a great reformer could reduce by half
their numbers he would be inclined to lay no hand upon
the total sum they now enjoy. But this necessity of
cleansing the public services is not peculiar to Yugoslavia.
The politicians must have courage to lay heavier taxes
on the peasants: the strange phenomenon is seen of
peasants who assert that they are quite prepared for
this, and on the other hand of politicians who are frightened
lest it lose them many votes. The peasants generally
are so prosperous that some, for instance, whom I know
of near Kragujevac, men occupied in growing cereals,
find that the fowls which they keep rather as a hobby
do not have to lay them golden eggs in order to pay all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the taxes. In that region it is usual nowadays for
peasants not to count their bank-notes, but to weigh
them; recently a man disposed of certain fields for his
own weight in notes of ten dinars. The peasants are not
only dissatisfied with the two chief parties, the Radicals
and the Democrats, for not taxing them sufficiently&mdash;so
that at the next general election they may give a good
deal more support than hitherto to their own Peasants'
party&mdash;but they complain that their interests are neglected
although, as we have seen, the lawyers and other townsfolk
of the Radical and Democrat parties are so anxious
with respect to peasants' votes.</p>

<p>The difficult position of the Yugoslavs&mdash;observe how
in the last year their exchange has fallen&mdash;is due in part
to the deplorable activities of other peoples (vast amounts
have had to be imported for reconstruction purposes,
Rieka has been practically unavailable as a port, and
conditions have been such that the Yugoslavs have had
to keep a large army mobilized), partly their position
is due to measures ill-advised but which they were compelled
to take (such as their system of Agrarian Reform),
partly to political inexperience and partly to their lack
of organizing powers. Let us hope that from now onwards
Yugoslavia will have to arm herself less heavily
against the slings and arrows of the world, and that she
will be able therefore to become a more proficient swimmer
in this sea of troubles.</p>


<p class="section">SERB AND BULGAR</p>

<p>A map of the Balkan migrations, with its curved
lines leading almost everywhere, is a bewildering spectacle;
but if we study the main clusters of lines we shall see
that the people whose movements they chronicle have
frequently preserved, in a remarkable fashion, certain
common characteristics: thus a stream flowed from the
south-west towards Valjevo in Serbia, and it is interesting
to notice how the prominent men of that region, whose
ancestors came from somewhere between Montenegro
and the old frontiers of Serbia, have all of them certain
characteristics&mdash;a talent for foreign languages, a subtlety
of reasoning, originality but insufficient observation, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
clever but fallacious minds. Similarly in the Bulgar
there are qualities which even now can be ascribed to
the Mongol blood. The Bulgar is more stolid than the
Serb; he is less given to sympathy and on that account
can be cruel. The Bulgar is benevolent because he is
urged by kindliness, whereas the more impressionable
Serb is under the influence both of sentiment, sentimentality
and sympathy. These differences of temperament&mdash;and
there are others, more or less distinguishable&mdash;do
not seem to Balkan thinkers any reason why the two
should keep apart. And a couple of months after the
Great War, during which the Bulgars, as their best friends
must acknowledge, were far from irreproachable in
occupied Serbia&mdash;partly this was due to the vast number
of new posts for which they had no suitable men&mdash;a few
months afterwards a Bulgarian engineer was placidly
working among the Serbs at &#268;a&#269;ak railway station,
wearing his own uniform. And a Serbian butcher who
emigrated to Bulgaria settled down at Ferdinand just
before the War and has lived there unmolested up to
this day, and that in spite of his not being very highly
esteemed&mdash;for, as the police president told me, he had
married a woman with more wealth than good fame;
the president had been among her lovers.... One would
not suppose that the contrasting public morality of the
two countries will keep them apart. It is easy enough for
us to argue that this morality is on a pretty low level,
because a Bulgarian War Minister saw fit to sue, under a
<i>nom de guerre</i>, a French armament firm which omitted to
send him the stipulated commission; because another
Minister, incarcerated on account of felony, could be
liberated by the grace of Tzar Ferdinand and become
Premier; because a Serbian Minister used to buy himself
corner-houses, while his Bulgarian colleagues seem to own
most of the houses in Sofia. There was a minor Serbian
official over against whom I took my meals for about a
month; one of his ways was to produce a pocket-knife
and cut his bread with it. Certain other parts of his
ritual did not appeal to me, but who knows whether I
did not disgust him by breaking my bread with my
fingers? And who knows what sentiments were awakened
some years ago at the Orthodox monastery of Gromirija,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
in Croatia, when a foreign guest proposed to wash himself
in water, though by the joyous custom of that house
there was no other liquid on the premises but wine?
If there is in both countries, in Serbia and Bulgaria, a
movement against the cynicism which does not clothe
its corruption with a decent Western drapery, that is
something; if there is a further movement in the direction
of probity, that is something more. And, whatever
some Serbs may tell you, it is undeniable that honesty
has made important strides in the public life of that
kingdom, even without having added to the Statute
Book those rigorous proposals of the newly-formed
Peasants' party, one of which would punish a peculating
official with death. It is, however, apparent that this
party has not arrived at a sense of discretion, for it wants
to terminate the practice of allowing pensions to officials,
so that each man is obliged to make his own provision
for old age. Bulgaria, the younger country, has made
a proportionate progress; there is trustworthy German
evidence to the effect that the corrupt Radoslavoff
Government was despised by the people, not in the hour
of disaster but in 1916, when the Bulgarian soldiers
changed the words of an anti-Serb song and instead of
"Our old allies are brigands" proclaimed that "the
Liberals are brigands." This German, Dr. Helmut von
den Steinen, the correspondent of the <i>Nordeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</i> (in which he was bound to speak
favourably of Radoslavoff) used to deliver propaganda
lectures in the Bulgarian language at Sofia during the
War. He was very well acquainted with Bulgarian
affairs and being summoned to Berlin at the end of 1917
he made a speech<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> <i>in camera</i> to a committee of German
savants and artists. In the course of this he lamented
that his country had attached herself to Radoslavoff,
who, said he, was hated and would at the next elections
be swept away.</p>

<p>As one must repeat <i>ad nauseam</i>, the gulf between
Serb and Bulgar has not been caused by an extreme
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>divergence of their private or their public morals, academically
considered, but by the various incidents which in
the eyes of each of them testified to the other's depravity.
And at the bottom of it all was Macedonia&mdash;Macedonia
which now, being wisely administered, will be the foundation-stone
of Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>At the end of his book, <i>Balkan Problems and European
Peace</i>, Mr. Noel Buxton agrees that such a Yugoslav
Federation has become a practical possibility. But his
two alternative proposals with respect to what should
meanwhile be the fate of Macedonia would indefinitely
postpone that Federation. We have already dealt with
the proposal of autonomy, put forward also by Mr.
Leland Buxton. As for what Mr. Noel Buxton calls
the ideal solution&mdash;"a plebiscite conducted by an impartial
international commission over the whole of the
historical province of Macedonia"&mdash;this is aiming no
higher than at a perpetuation of the two distinct
countries, Serbia and Bulgaria. We should probably
have had more plebiscites in Europe if more Allied
armies had been available, but the campaign of intimidation
and every sort of ruthlessness which occurred in
Upper Silesia and Schleswig make us look rather askance
upon this method of registering the popular will. Mr.
Buxton airily asks for a plebiscite over the whole of the
historical province of Macedonia, ignoring altogether the
special difficulty that "Macedonia" means something
quite different to the Serb, the Bulgar and the Greek.
He dismisses likewise the universal difficulty of plebiscites,
which is to be just in laying down the limits of the various
regions. But there is really no need for Mr. Buxton to
take us on to those quagmires, since he knows, and is good
enough to tell us, what the result of the plebiscite will be.
"The Bulgarian sympathies," says he, "of the mass of
the Macedonian population are apparent to every inquiring
traveller." If Mr. Buxton were to encounter
one of those pretty lawless Karaka&#269;an nomads, who
from the Monastir district wander all over the Balkans,
his recognition of the man's Roman and Thraco-Illyrian
descent would be facilitated by the permanent cheesy
odour which pervades his person. There is nothing so
permanent about the Macedonian Slav. His sympathies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
as is natural, have gone out to that Balkan country which
cultivated him and since, as Dr. Milovanovi&#263;, the Serbian
statesman, says, "the Serbs did not begin to think about
Macedonia till 1885," it would indeed have been extraordinary
if the Macedonian Slavs&mdash;whose ethnical
position, as scientists agree, is such a vague one&mdash;had
been generally drawn to Serbia. One cannot help feeling
that in this book Mr. Buxton does a serious disservice to
his reputation as a Balkan expert. He says that Serbia
until the accession of King Peter was Austrophil; which
is, to put it mildly, a very sweeping remark&mdash;only that
party which called itself Progressive was identified with
Milan's views. He praises the Bulgars for being devoted
to their national Church, and praises them for producing
a large number of Protestants, whose sincerity, etc.,
so that one presumes he would have praised them still
more if the whole nation, as was once on the cards, had
joined the Protestant Church. Save me from my
friends! the Bulgars might say. What is perfectly
sincere about them is their patriotism; and while some
of those who now change their religion have doubtless
no ulterior, personal motive, the entire country would
probably have as little reluctance as Japan in adopting
any religion which, like the Exarchist Church of to-day,
would be an instrument of the national cause. Mr.
Buxton's knowledge of the Balkan protagonists has its
limitations; for example, prior to Bulgaria's entry into
the War he was all for the removal of the British Minister
on account of his pro-Serbian sympathies, but he says
no word about M. Savinsky, the Russian Minister, who
was left by his Entente colleagues to play the first violin.
This capricious gentleman was no diplomat, but a courtier.
He did not even protest when German munitions for
Turkey passed through Roumania, and far too much of
his time was spent in motoring with pretty girls in the
neighbourhood of Sofia. Many good observers were of
opinion that with a more competent Russian representative,
such as M. Nekludoff, who in 1914 was transferred
to Stockholm, the situation would have been
saved. In their memorandum submitted in January
1915 to Lord (then Sir Edward) Grey, Messrs. N. and C.&nbsp;R.
Buxton said that their experience of fifteen years convinced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
them that the Bulgarian sentiment of the Macedonians
could not in a short time be made to give
way to another national sentiment. If we rule out, as
being slaves of circumstance, all the Macedonians who
now tell you that from Bulgar they have changed to
Serb, there is no reason why we should not credit those
who are so weary of the rival activities of both parties
that they wish for peace and nothing else. They would
follow, not the Messrs. Buxton, but the priest of the
Bulgarian village of Chuprenia, who told me that he held
that one might pray to God for the success of the
Bulgarian arms, without saying whether they were in
the right or in the wrong. After the end of the war
this priest sent a telegram, which was perhaps a little
indiscreet, advocating that the Bulgarian people should
join in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>To prevent the Southern Slavs being torn by internal
strife, it is necessary between Serbia and Bulgaria that
one of them should for a time be paramount. We may
be confident that Serbia will not abuse her position. In
fact it is the opinion of a Roumanian lady at Monastir
that the Serbs were uncommonly rash in taking into
their service so many who once had called themselves
Bulgars and now maintain that they are Serbs. But
Serbia has become relatively so strong that she can be
indulgent. She will even satisfy that Bulgarian professor
who is said to have discussed the Macedonian
question with the British military attach&eacute;.</p>

<p>The attach&eacute; suggested a division between Serbia and
Bulgaria.</p>

<p>"No," said the professor; "let the country remain a
whole, like the child before Solomon."</p>

<p>"Would you be satisfied?" asked the attach&eacute;, "if this
question were now decided once and for all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the professor, "if the judge be another
Solomon."</p>

<p>Among the Bulgars who are looking forward to the
day when their country will, in some form or other,
join Yugoslavia, there are some who suggest that when
comparative tranquillity has been assured upon the
Macedonian frontiers (that is to say, between Macedonia
and the Albanians) it would be as well to garrison the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
province with Croatian regiments, pending the employment
in their own country of Macedonian troops. Gradually
the time will come when, as one of the units of the
Yugoslav State, Macedonia will enjoy the same amount
of Home Rule as the other provinces. She will then,
maybe, decide for herself such matters as the <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'preservaiton'">preservation</ins>
of her dialects, local administration, police, etc.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">Once on the banks of the Danube when I was going
to sail from one of these countries to her neighbour with
whom she had recently been at war, and some of the
inhabitants had kindly come to see me off, I was presented,
amongst other things, with an old gentleman's
good wishes, which he had taken the trouble to express in
French and in verse. I believe that he recited them,
but there was a considerable tumult on the landing-stage.
Then a very angry traveller appropriated one of
my ears and began to tell me that they were for detaining
him in this country; three or four natives of the country
reported, simultaneously, into my other ear that he had
been letting off his revolver and was altogether a
dangerous man. I was to settle whether he should sail
or not, and meanwhile his luggage had been put ashore.
He waved his passport in my face. Both he and his
opponents were gesticulating with great violence, and
this they continued to do even after I filled their hands
with most of the small and large bouquets which the
friendly people had brought down for me. There was so
much noise that the boat's whistle, which the captain
started, was no more than a forest-tree soaring slightly
over those around it. As I tried to disentangle myself
from those who encircled me I caught sight of the old
gentleman of the poem&mdash;in appearance he was a smaller
edition of the late Dr. Butler of Trinity; he was clearly
nervous lest I should depart without his lines, which he
extended towards me, written on the back of one of his
visiting-cards. I was just then being told by the agitated
traveller that he had only been firing into the air because
it was Easter, and that this was his invariable custom at
midnight on Easter-Eve. The explanation was so satisfactory
that everyone welcomed my suggestion that he
should sail and that they should send his revolver on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
him by parcel post. They all shook hands with him.
The two nationalities were on excellent terms. And we
may transfer the old gentleman's good wishes to them
and the other Yugoslavs:</p>
